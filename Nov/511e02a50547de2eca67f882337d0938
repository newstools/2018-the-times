A manhunt is under way for two men - one of whom walks with a limp - who were filmed on CCTV killing a man inside his car at a shopping centre parking lot in the Free State town of Welkom. Police spokesperson captain Stephen Thakeng said on Sunday the brazen shooting happened at the Commando shopping centre in Welkom at around 5:30pm on Saturday evening. In a video being shared on social media, 54-year-old Shai Mikia Mohapi is seen sitting inside his blue Volkswagen Polo. Two men are seen slowly approaching his vehicle. One of the men pretends to be on the phone, while the second opens the door of the car and fires several shots at Mohapi. The men then drag the lifeless body out of the car. They get in the car and drive off. Thakeng, who confirmed the identity of the slain man, said Mohapi was shot three times in the chest and twice in his left arm. He was declared dead on the scene. His car was later found abandoned next to Diggers Inn.Â Police are investigating a case of murder and hijacking.
