One person was killed and 37 others injured on Thursday afternoon when a bus overturned on the N3 near Nottingham Road in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in apparently wet weather‚ paramedics said. “ER24 paramedics‚ along with several other services‚ arrived on the scene to find the wrecked bus on the side of the highway. Several people had already climbed out of the bus and were found walking around on the scene. “On closer inspection‚ paramedics found that one patient‚ a woman‚ had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately‚ nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead‚” said ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring. “37 other patients were assessed on the scene. One was found to be in a critical condition while 36 had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate‚” he added. He said the victims were treated for their injuries and the critically injured person provided with advanced life support interventions before being transported to various hospitals for further treatment. “Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.”
