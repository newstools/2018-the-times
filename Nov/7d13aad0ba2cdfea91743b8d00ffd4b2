The Oprah Winfrey magic has gripped Mzansi as she delivered a powerful keynote speech at the Is’thunzi Sabafazi (Dignity of Women) currently underway at the UJ Soweto Campus. Oprah paid tribute to Madiba and spoke fondly of the time she spent with him at the event which is part of the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 celebrations. "I said to Mandela that one day I will build a school and it will be a school for girls because I believe that women will save South Africa. We have just had our first doctor graduate," Oprah said. Oprah encouraged people to look beyond themselves and think about how they could help someone closest to them. Oprah encouraged people to own their truth no matter what. "Tell your story. There is power in your story, no matter how devastating. There is not one thing that did not happen to you that did not also happen for you." Madiba's widow, humanitarian and politician Graça Machel said the centenary celebrations would be incomplete without her. "I knew these celebrations would be totally incomplete if Oprah didn't grace us with her presence, her voice, her power. Oprah, we as South Africa, we as the world, will never have the time to thank you enough."
