The family of a Mozambican taxi driver Mido Macia, who died at the hands of police, will be compensated adequately, attorney Jose Nascimento said on Wednesday. Nascimento represented the Macia family in their lawsuit against the police. "We are happy with the conclusion of the matter. Happy that it didn't go to a full-blown trial," said Nascimento. The Mozambican national died in police custody in 2013 after being dragged behind a police van and, later, physically assaulted by police officers. The incident, in Daveyton, east of Johannesburg, was captured on camera and received international coverage. The Macia family sued the police minister for R6.5m. "We would like to give all the facts but there is a confidentiality clause, which our legal team accepted without hesitation," he told the media. Nascimento said the money to be paid out was less than what they had initially requested, but that it was enough to support Macia's parents, his common-law wife and his eight-year-old son. "It was important to let the world know the finality of this important matter, which could not be swept under the carpet," he said. Speaking about the plight of the family, Nascimento said they were struggling because they had lost a breadwinner. “This compensation is going to help them greatly, and will definitely enhance the quality of life of young Sergio and  the parents." Nine police officers were arrested for Macia’s murder. One was found not guilty and the other eight are serving prison terms. Nascimento said he hoped the state would make the payout soon. “While we are satisfied with the outcome, it is important to note that a life of a young man was unnecessarily lost. No amount of money in the world can compensate for the loss of a son, father and husband,” he said. Reflecting on how the negotiations went, Nascimento said SA had respect for the rule of law because police officers were paying their dues in prison, and the family was compensated.
