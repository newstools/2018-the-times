The minister of state security has ordered a re-vetting of all intelligence officials in a bid to root out spies accused of looting the slush fund of up to R1bn. But insiders at the State Security Agency (SSA) say the exercise is nothing but a purge of spooks deemed loyal to former director-general Arthur Fraser and, by extension, former president Jacob Zuma. In a terse communiqué to staff on Tuesday Dipuo Letstatsi-Duba announced that she would be re-vetting all agents using the intelligence divisions of the South African Police Service and the South African National Defence Force. “Due to recent developments in the SSA, which border on serious misconduct and ill-discipline by intelligence officers, the minister has taken a decision for a sporadic re-vetting of officials, which will be suitably performed outside of the agency,” she said. “The misconduct borders on a serious security risk and threatens the integrity of the institution. The minister has taken serious note of this and decided that such behaviour cannot go without action.” She said she took the drastic decision when staff revolted at plans to change the management and reporting lines at the agency. A forum that represents all intelligence and non-intelligence staff has written a memo urging employees to reject the structure. Full story in the Sunday Times
