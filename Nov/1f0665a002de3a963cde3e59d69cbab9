Two senior figures in Cape Town’s underworld ordered a R1m hit on top gang lawyer Pete Mihalik, well-placed sources told the Sunday Times this week. The order was sent to a jailed armed robber, who asked a taxi boss in Gugulethu to recruit two hitmen. Mihalik was shot dead as he dropped his children at school in Green Point on Tuesday. Two KwaZulu-Natal men, Sizwe Biyela, 26 and Nkosinathi Khumalo, 31, appeared in the Cape Town magistrate’s court on Thursday in connection with the shooting. According to the sources, they were paid R250,000 each and the taxi boss was paid R500,000. Police and an army of underworld figures are scouring the Cape Flats for the alleged middle man, and a source said: “Unless he lawyers up and makes sure he’s protected, then someone will try to take him out because he is the only one who can talk and say where it [the hit] comes from.” It is understood that Mihalik will not have a public funeral, to avoid what a source said could be “a bloodbath”.  Mihalik’s eight-year-old son is said to be recovering well after one of the assassin’s bullets was removed from his jaw.
