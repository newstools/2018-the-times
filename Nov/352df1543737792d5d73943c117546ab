From his campaign days to his time in office, US President Donald Trump has had a tumultuous relationship with reporters. Seeing Trump engage in heated debates with journalists has become the norm. In one recent exchange with a journalist from CNN after the midterm elections, Trump walked away from his podium and refused to take more questions.Here are five spicy moments between Trump and reporters. 1. Trump vs CNN reporterCNN reporter Jim Acosta's White House press pass was revoked after the reporter got into a heated exchange with the president. Acosta was asking  Trump a question about his remarks on the Migrant Caravan during a press conference on the midterm elections. "You are a rude, terrible person. You shouldn't be working for CNN," Trump said. He further referred to Acosta as "the enemy of the people." 2. "No, not you, your organisation is terrible"At a press conference in 2017 in New York, Trump refused to respond to questions asked by a CNN reporter. In the same address, the president described the news publication BuzzFeed as "a failing pile of garbage". 3. "That's a racist question"  President Trump shut down an African-American reporter who asked Trump about referring to himself as a nationalist. Trump immediately shot down the reporter's question by responding "that's such a racist question". 4. Trump vs ABC reporterThe US President insulted a CBS reporter last month at a White House press conference to discuss the US-Canada-Mexico trade agreement. Trump responded to the nervous female reporter by saying "I know you're not thinking, you never do" 5. "Sit down be quiet"In 2015, during his campaign in Iowa, Univision reporter Jorge Ramos was kicked out of a press conference after asking a question on immigration. "Excuse me, sit down, weren't called". Trump further said "go back to Univision."
