Protesters who gathered outside the Lenasia magistrate's court on Tuesday performed the latest dance moves as they sang old-school struggle songs. The group were attending the bail application of two men accused of killing seven family members in Vlakfontein last month. The case was postponed due to a power outage. Outside the court, the group added several dance moves inspired by the idibala, Thuso Phala and vosho challenges. The idibala dance challenge has gone viral in recent weeks as people took to social media to give their best version of the King Monada hit, Malwede.
