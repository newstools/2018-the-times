Rapper Lection has cemented his place in the industry with his latest track Ale Duma Ye, which comes four years after his hugely popular song Basadi. It can't be called a come back if you never went anywhere but while chatting to TshisaLIVE, the rapper explained that while he's "not in your face" he hasn't stopped working. Lection said he felt like  he was in the best shape he's ever been musically. "I've never stopped working. For the past two years, I've spent time in the studio making music that I love. Music that comes from good space and from good harmony. I find inspiration in life and realised that I have been surrounded by people who believe in me." Lection shared that late hip-hop star HHP has been a mentor to him for the past eight years and helped him reach his full potential. "In all the years I've known him (HHP) we spent most of it just talking and enjoying each other's company. With me having the privilege to observe HHP in his element as he experimented with different sounds, especially in the last two years. He was a brilliant artist," Lection said. Lection's latest tract Ale Dume E has been blasting all over the radios and he's explained the process behind it. "The chorus itself was taken from a famous boxing match. It was the one where Muhammad Ali fought George Foreman in the Congo, the crowd liked Ali more and kept shouting 'Ali, boma ye' which means Ali kill him. But we switched it up and put a bit of s'Pitori in it. Where we are asking 'which one do you want'" The song which is all about the celebration of what motswako actually means - a mixture. Lection said that despite the genre being described as using Setswana or vernacular languages in the lyrics, they wanted to show that a mixture also means they can fuse house, kwaito and hip-hop.
