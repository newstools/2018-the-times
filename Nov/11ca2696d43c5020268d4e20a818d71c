The Discovery Bank, which is due to launch in March 2019, will be a completely digital “behavioural bank” and the latest manifestation of Discovery’s shared-value insurance model, it was announced on Wednesday. Discovery chief executive Adrian Gore says the bank is built on the tried and tested Vitality model: behaviour that is good for business is good for consumers and for society.
