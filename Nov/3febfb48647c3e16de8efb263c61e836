Police in the Eastern Cape are searching for a gang of about 15 heavily armed suspects who attempted to rob a cash-in-transit van near Mqanduli on Friday morning. The gang fled empty-handed after the explosives they were using failed to detonate. Police said the G4S cash-in-transit van was travelling from Mthatha towards Mqanduli at about 7.30am on Friday when two white Isuzu double cab bakkies blocked the road in front of and behind the van at Lower Ngqwarha‚ Mqanduli. “It is alleged that 15 heavily armed suspects with rifles and AK47s alighted from the two vehicles and started shooting at the G4S vehicle. Two 9mm pistol firearms were taken from the two guards who were with the driver of the G4S vehicle. “The driver and his two guards were instructed to lie down on the ground while the suspects tried to put their explosives on the vehicle. Upon realising that the explosives didn't work‚ the suspects got into their vehicles and also hijacked a green Isuzu double cab which was also used as a getaway vehicle‚” police said. “The police are still following up on information and they are hot on the heels of the suspects‚” they added.
