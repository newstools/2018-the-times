South African Revenue Service (Sars) commissioner Tom Moyane was dismissed from the post by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday. This came after a string of controversies at Sars during Moyaneâ€™s tenure, including a R50bn hole in the revenue collection in 2017 and a decline in taxpayer compliance under his watch. The mismanagement of Sars has been blamed for this shortfall.
