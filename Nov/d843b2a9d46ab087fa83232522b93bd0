Police have arrested a man for assault after he was accused of pulling a gun on a group of Somali teens at a McDonald's restaurant in Minneapolis in the US. The Star Tribune reports "a Somali teenager said she confronted a white man at a McDonaldâ€™s in Eden Prairie over what she took as an ethnic slight and that he responded by waving a handgun at her and other young people before leaving." The news site said the man stumbled backwards and out of the door. At that point, the teens quickly backed away, and several people shouted that the man was holding a gun. A gun cannot be seen in the video. A police report said the man allegedly pulled the firearm from his waistband, according to the Star Tribune. A manager is seen in the video ordering the young people out of the restaurant.
