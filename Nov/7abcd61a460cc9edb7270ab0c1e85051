Friends, fans and family members came out in their numbers at the Mmabatho Convention Centre, in Mahikeng North West on Saturday to bid a heart felt farewell to South African Hip Hop icon Jabulani "HHP" Tsambo. Tsambo was laid to rest on Saturday at the Mmabatho Cemetery, Mahikeng. The Bosso hitmaker was described as "a gentle giant" who was hailed for putting motswako music on the map. Jabba was applauded for the impact he made to the Mahikeng community and for being an inspiration to young people. A sorrowful letter penned by Tsambo's mother was read out on her behalf at the funeral service. “Boy I can’t believe it’s been 10 days since you left us. Jabu, there was an incredible feeling of joy when I saw you take your first breath and an incredible feeling of emptiness when I learned you had taken your last but between those two breaths there are 38 years good years which I'm truly and forever thankful to God for." Among mourners who attended the funeral service was rapper Cassper Nyovest who was one of Jabba's protégés.
