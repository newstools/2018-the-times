South Sudan on Friday released rebel leader Riek Machar's spokesman and a South African adviser from prison, a Reuters witness said. To reinforce a peace deal signed in September, President Salva Kiir on Wednesday ordered the release of retired South African colonel William Endley, an adviser to Machar, and James Gatdet, Machar's spokesman. The Reuters witness at the prison where they were held saw the two being asked to go and put on their civilian clothes after being brought out of their cell.
