A woman was shot dead and a man seriously wounded in a shooting at a food outlet at a taxi rank in Durban on Sunday morning. Netcare 911 spokesperson Shawn Herbst said the incident had occurred at a shop at the Warwick taxi rank on Canongate Road in Berea at around 8:35am. “Reports from the scene indicate that an adult female was shot dead and an adult male had sustained a gunshot wound and was left in a critical condition. “The patient was treated on scene by an advanced life support paramedic and once stabilised was rapidly transported to hospital for further treatment,” Herbst said. “Circumstances leading up to the shooting are unknown and will form the subject of an investigation by police, who were on scene,” he added.
