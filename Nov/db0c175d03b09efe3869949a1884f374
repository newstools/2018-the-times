One of the most frequent words to come out of Cassper Nyovest's mouth is the word "humble" and the rapper has on multiple occasions been called out for his excessive flexing, which is the complete opposite of the humility he claims to display. Chatting to East Coast Drive’s Bongani and Mags Cassper also addressed accusations of being ‘fake humble’. "The fact that I still have the same people that I used to have before my fame (around me) and they still think I am the same person, I’m good." Listen to rest of the interview here: The Tito Mboweni rapper, who reckons that he has a healthy balance between humility and pride said that if the "day ones" in his life don't see the fake humbleness that seems to be a "social media" thing, then he ain't worried about it. The rapper, who has temporarily relocated to Durban in an attempt to emerge himself in the KZN culture before his #FillUpMosesMabhida concert this December has recently shared that humility is one of the traits he learnt from the late rapper HHP. HHP died in a suspected suicide on October 24 at his home in Randpark Ridge. Speaking at his Johannesburg memorial, Cassper said HHP always told him to remain humble and never let fame give him a big head. When Cassper took to the stage at Bassline on Tuesday afternoon to pay tribute to his "big brother" he had the crowd in laughter as he remembered how HHP humbled him. Cassper recalled how during a performance in Maftown, HHP pulled off his sunglasses and schooled him about acting like a superstar in ikasi. "That moment lived with me. I have to keep humbling myself and living by some of the things I learnt from Jabba."
