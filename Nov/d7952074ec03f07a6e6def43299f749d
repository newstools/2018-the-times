The Ingonyama Trust Board has vowed to fight a court application that aims to compel it to stop forcing occupiers of land that falls under the trust to pay rent. The application was filed by the Legal Resources Centre on behalf of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, the Rural Womenâ€™s Movement and seven informal land rights holders, who are challenging the conversion of informal land rights to long-term lease agreements.
