Raheem Sterling struck twice as Premier League leaders Manchester City crushed Southampton 6-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, the fourth time they have scored five or more goals in the 11 games so far this season. City, who have a two-point lead over Liverpool, took just six minutes to open the scoring. David Silva fed Leroy Sane on the left and the German’s low cross was turned by Southampton defender Wesley Hoedt into his own net. Six minutes later and City were 2-0 up after Bernardo Silva fed Sterling on the right and the England winger’s low cross was slotted home from close range by Sergio Aguero, the Argentine’s 17th goal in his last 13 home games. The game was virtually over by the 18th minute when Sterling’s cross from the right eventually found Silva whose left-foot drive flew past the helpless Alex McCarthy. Southampton got a little encouragement when Danny Ings was brought down by City keeper Ederson and rose to convert the spot kick in the 30th minute but on the stroke of half-time City restored their three-goal advantage when Aguero passed to Sterling inside the box and he took his time before firing home. Sterling struck again to make it 5-1, drilling into the bottom corner after being slipped in by the unselfish Aguero and Sane completed the rout in stoppage time.
