Michelle Obama's memoir was released on Tuesday and has received an overwhelmingly positive response from people who have already lapped up the private details that the former first lady has never shared before. In the book titled Becoming, Obama lets the public in on intimate details of her life as a young girl, being the first African-American first lady of the US and a miscarriage she suffered two decades ago. She also revealed that her daughters, Malia and Sasha, were conceived through in-vitro fertilisation. In the book, Obama also describes how Donald Trump's claims that her husband was not US-born affected her and her family. According to the US Constitution, only natural-born citizens qualify for presidency. By alleging that Barack Obama did not meet this requirement, Trump effectively challenged the legality of Obama's presidency. Trump later deserted those claims, but offered no apology for making them in the first place. Obama wrote in her book that she would "never forgive" him because the accusations put her family in danger. Not being one to take blows lying down, Trump didn't hold back when heÂ reacted to the book. He said that Michelle Obama was "paid a lot of money" for the book and controversy was expected. "I'll give you a little controversy back, I'll never forgive [President Obama] for what he did to our US military. It was depleted and I had to fix it." Barack, however, didn't let Trump get to him and instead focussed on his power wife. Celebrities were among those who had eagerly awaited the book and they gave their own reviews. The former US first lady is currently on an international tour to promote the book. Ticket prices for the tour begin at $700. Some people skipped the tour and spent their money on the book itself. They excitedly posted images of their copies.
