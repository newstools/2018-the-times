A biker who works for a jewellery store was forced off the road and robbed of cash and jewellery worth estimated R1m in Edenvale, Johannesburg, on Tuesday afternoon. Police spokesperson Const Patricia Mgijima told TimesLIVE on Wednesday afternoon that the man was travelling from Germiston to Edenvale when he was attacked. "He works for a company which sells jewellery, gold and diamonds. He had cash of R100,000," Mgijima said. In dramatic footage, the man is seen being forced off his motorbike by a group of armed men. The man and the motorbike are then searched. A few seconds later, the suspects get into a white Volkswagen Golf GTI and flee. "They demanded the keys for the storage box of the motorbike.
