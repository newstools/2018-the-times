Community members of crime ridden Hanover Park were elated whenÂ President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the area on Friday. The president took a walkabout in the troubled Cape Town township, in the same street where Gift of the Givers volunteer Ameerodien Noordien was allegedly shot and killed as a result of gang violence. Members of the community shook hands with Ramaphosa as he announced a new anti-gang strategy for the area on November 2 2018. He also used the opportunity to issue out a stern warning to those responsible for gang violence and crime, telling them that their days were numbered. "I want to tell you that our presence here is to demonstrate that the days of gangsters is running out, it's over. We are here to give them a clear notice that we are coming after them. "Passop you as a gangster. Jy moet nou hardloop en jy moet baie, baie vinnig hardloop want ons kom agter jou. Passop ons kom nou nou by jou." (Watch out to all those involved in gang violence. You better run and run very fast because we are coming after you. Watch out, we are coming after you.) Hanover Park resident Jeanette Fredricks said following Ramaphosa's visit she had her hope restored and now believed that gangsterism in the Western Cape province would finally come to an end. "We are glad that the president is here in Hanover Park. We were waiting for the president to come and to speak to the people. I'm just glad that they are doing something now for the people, not just for Hanover Park, but for the whole of Western Cape to help us take gangsterism out of the communities."
