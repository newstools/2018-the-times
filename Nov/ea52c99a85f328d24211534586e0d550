A leaked sex tape of Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has appeared on the world's biggest porn site, PornHub. In 2017 the site claimed to have 28.5-billion annual visitors. The video of Gigaba trended on the site for much of Monday. On Tuesday morning it had a 20% thumbs down ranking. This ranking is a live indication of reaction from users and changes on a minute-to-minute basis. Gigaba last week apologised for the video and said it was meant for private use between him and his wife. He also claimed that the video had been taken from his phone after his phone was hacked. The video on PornHub has received over 44,000 views so far. It is unclear when it was uploaded onto the site.
