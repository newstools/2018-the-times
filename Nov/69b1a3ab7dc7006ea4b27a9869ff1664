South African free press advocate Angela Quintal and her colleague, Muthoki Mumo, have left Tanzania - a day after they were detained in the East African nation. Quintal’s relative, Genevieve Quintal, broke the news on social media on Thursday night. Due to concerns that Angela Quintal's devices and social media had been "compromised", the former newspaper editor would "not be in a position to communicate". “Angela Quintal and Muthoki Muno are out of Tanzania. Angela has asked me to thank everyone for the support and solidarity. Her devices and social media accounts have been compromised & until this is sorted out she will not be in a position to communicate. A big thank you to all!" she tweeted. The department of international relations (Dirco) said earlier on Thursday their passports were returned after they were detained on Wednesday by law enforcement in Tanzania. According to Dirco, High Commissioner of South Africa in Tanzania, Thami Mseleku, was instructed by international relations minister Lindiwe Sisulu to gather the facts around their detention and report to Pretoria by end of Thursday. “Following meetings with the Tanzanian authorities this morning, the High Commissioner has indicated that the two journalists are now free to leave Tanzania. “The Minister thanked High Commissioner Mseleku, the team at the Dirco 24-hour call centre, and diplomats from Kenya and Tanzania for resolving the matter speedily.” Sisulu said: “We are happy that this matter has been resolved, the two journalists have their passports, and they can travel today.”
