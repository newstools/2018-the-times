The SABC was evidently listening to Mzansi when they named King Monada's viral track Malwede as song of the year. The public broadcaster released the prelim list for its annual Summer Song Of The Year and King Monada. Twitter is totes excited but the competition is mad tight! Not only does Monada have to go against the originator of 'Yebo!' Busiswa who is featured in Prince Kaybee's Banomoya, he's also competing with Vusi  Nova's smooth vocals in As'phelelanga and AKA's Fela in Versace among other amazing songs! While there's no denying that Malwede is one of the strongest contenders on the list, these things are always tricky because wherever the matter is left to the public, the results are always unpredictable. Y'all remember how KwaZulu-Natal maskandi artist, Mroza Fakude, walked away with a R150,000 cash prize and a brand new Kia Picanto after his hit song Van Damme was voted as SABC's Song Of The Year For 2016. The competition was also really heated that year but when the clock struck 12, the whole country was left shook. Anywho, the list that was released is only preliminary but so far it looks like most people were here for it! And if comments under the tweet are anything to go by... tweeps will be idibaling this December... But to be honest all those songs are hits! The summer is a lituation already.
