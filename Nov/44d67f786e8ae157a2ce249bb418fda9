If you think you're having a bad day, chances are it's not as bad as the one this woman experienced when she smashed a BMW i8 into a neighbour's house. Video footage making the rounds on social media shows a woman reversing out of a driveway. Her foot, however, is too heavy on the accelerator as she goes straight over a neighbour's pot plant and light pole before crashing against the wall of the house. The distraught woman then climbs out of the car and stares at the damage in disbelief as onlookers try to comfort her. It's unclear if the car belongs to the woman, but either way it's going to cost her dearly.
