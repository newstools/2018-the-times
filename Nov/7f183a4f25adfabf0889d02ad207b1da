President Cyril Ramaphosa announced his new cabinet on Thursday and the fact that Bathabile Dlamini remains a minister did not sit well with social media. Ramaphosa announced that Siyabonga Cwele replaces Malusi Gigaba as home affairs minister. Cwele is the former minister of telecommunications and postal services, a department which will be merged into a single unit together with the communications department. The department will be headed by Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. The introduction of a young female into a ministerial position was largely welcomed by the public. However, the fact that Dlamini remains in her position as minister of women in the presidency was a bitter pill to swallow for many. In September, the Constitutional Court found that Dlamini had been "reckless" in her handling of SA Social Security Agency grants payments while she was the social development minister. The court urged the director of public prosecutions to decide if she would be charged with perjury for being found to have lied under oath. Twitter was flooded with posts expressing disappointment in the president for retaining Dlamini.
