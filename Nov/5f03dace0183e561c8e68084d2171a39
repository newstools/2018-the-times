Witnessing a stampede of wildebeests is always an impressive sight, even more so when you get to see it from the sky. George Koposov captured this video during a hot air balloon flight over the Maasai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya. "When we were getting close to the animals they heard the air balloon and went to stampede," Koposov explained.
