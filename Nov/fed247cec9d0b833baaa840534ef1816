Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan is expected to conclude his testimony at the commission on Wednesday morning. Gordhan used his second day of testimony on Tuesday to lash back against a heightened attack on him from the Economic Freedom Fighters, challenging its leaders to make their allegations against him under oath to the commission where they could be subjected to cross-examination. “I don’t make deals for jobs ... I don't make deals with smugglers or taxpayers or submit to intimidation or bullying ... I’m not accountable to bullies,” he said. He also responded to criticism that he should resign because he had not previously declared his interactions with members of the Gupta family. “There was no meeting with the Guptas. I am quite emphatic that I am not for sale,” Gordhan said. Gordhan also told Justice Raymond Zondo how he had been repeatedly harassed, including through orchestrated social-media and fake-news campaigns, to force him to resign while he was finance minister. Former Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile is expected to take the stand afterwards. Fuzile quit as director general shortly after Malusi Gigaba was appointed as finance minister last year.
