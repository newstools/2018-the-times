The ANC on Thursday heaped praises on  President Cyril Ramaphosa for making changes to his cabinet- saying the reshuffle is an affirmation of generational mix and experience in the country's executive. This after Ramaphosa made three changes to his cabinet, promoting Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams to the now merged ministry of communications; telecommunications and postal services. Siyabonga Cwele was moved to home affairs and Nomvula Mokonyane shifted to environmental affairs. The ANC said  Cwele "brings the experience to tackle some urgent tasks in his new portfolio, such as the immigration issue and control of our ports of entry". In a statement, ANC spokesman Pule Mabe added that Mokonyane "will find a solid foundation in the ministry of environmental affairs laid by the late Cde Edna Molewa, and we urge her to continue to protect the rhino, other endangered species and our precious heritage of biodiversity". The governing party went on to say that Ndabeni, 40, who was deputy minister in the same department, would infuse young blood in the executive. "As the new minister of communications Cde Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams is a tried and tested young activist, having previously served as member of the ANC Youth League national working committee and currently as serving a member of the ANC provincial working committee in the Eastern Cape and the ANC’s communications committee," said Mabe. The party posited that the merger of communications with telecommunications and postal services would "contribute towards greater alignment of policy and delivery" in the so-called fourth industrial revolution.
