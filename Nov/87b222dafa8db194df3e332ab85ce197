Eight men were arrested at a house in Kroondal near Rustenburg while allegedly planning a cash-in-transit heist. National police spokesperson Col Brenda Muridili said they were arrested on Wednesday in a tactical operation by crime intelligence, tracking teams, the police air-wing and private company Magma Investigations in the North West. Muridili said the men were traced to a safe house and after being confronted by police, fled in four cars. Police were hot on their heels and arrested eight of them, aged between 33 and 42. Muridili said it was still unclear how many others had escaped. Four cars, including two sedans, an SUV and a minibus were recovered. Police also confiscated an assault rifle and ammunition. National police commissioner Gen Khehla Sitole said it was evident that the police's72-hour activation plan was "without fail continuing to coordinate multi-disciplinary teams across the country to respond to violent crimes". The suspects are expected to be charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery, possession of a prohibited firearm and ammunition and possession of stolen vehicles. The investigation has been transferred to the Hawks.
