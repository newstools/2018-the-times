South Africa were dismissed in double figures for the second time in three days St Lucia on Saturday to become first-round casualties in the World T20 (WT20). Having been bowled out for 76 by West Indies on Thursday — their lowest total when all 10 wickets have fallen — England sent the South Africans packing for 85, which equalled their second smallest 10-wicket total. Openers Danielle Wyatt and Tammy Beaumont put on 55 as England won by seven wickets in 14.1 overs to join Australia, India and West Indies in the semi-finals. South Africa are out of the running but still have to play their last group game against Bangladesh on Monday. Fast bowlers Natalie Sciver and Anya Shrubsole shared six wickets, with Shrubsole ending the innings by taking a hattrick. South Africa coach Hilton Moreeng laid the blame on his team’s batting, and deservedly so. “Once again, our batting was very frustrating with our batting,” Moreeng told reporters in St Lucia. “It just didn’t fire in this tournament. “Everyone in the changeroom is very disappointed because we know the quality we have. If you look at our overall game, the bowlers have actually bowled well and they were also backed up by good fielding.” Moreeng dismissed the theory that South Africa’s batters had been coached to curb their natural game — in particular big hitting opener Lizelle Lee, who scored 37 runs in three unusually tentative innings in the WT20. “Not at all. Some of the players got in a muddle, they just changed their game plan and approach.” Might the South Africans still have had the Windies game on their minds on Saturday? “I think what needed to be said was said against the game against West Indies,” Moreeng said. “And today we knew that we had to win. Everybody came in knowing that. “The attack was world class. They’ve just not been backed up by batters.”
