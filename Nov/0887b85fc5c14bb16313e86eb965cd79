Being a mom is evidently one of actressÂ Mapaseka "Pasi" Koetle- Nyokong most favourite roles. Everyone knows that juggling a career, being a mom and a wife isn't a walk in the park but Pasi makes it look like a breeze. Just like how she's a natural in front of the camera, Pasi steps into all the roles she plays with passion and naturally. The actress loves spending quality time with her little girl and doing all sorts of fun things with her, like wearing matching outfits for mommy-daughter photoshoots. Cute! During an interview with TshisaLIVE earlier this year, Pasi said that juggling so many hats weren't easy but she draws inspiration from women like her own mom. "It's not easy, I won't lie and say I'm chilling because I am not. But our mothers did it, with five or seven children. If they did it, so can we."
