A mobile clinic that will make voluntary circumcision more accessible for men has been launched in Cape Town. The facility, a joint initiative of nonprofit organisation Jhpiego and the Western Cape department of health, will also provide screenings for HIV and prostate cancer. The mobile unit will be able to provide 40 circumcisions a day. Voluntary circumcision not only helps protect men from getting sexually transmitted infections including HIV, but also lowers the risk of women partners developing cervical cancer. Males from the age of 15 were invited to visit the clinic and book their appointments for free circumcisions. The launch of the clinic, part of a ManUp campaign aimed at safe circumcision, was timed to coincide with the "Movember" moustache-growing campaign that draws attention to men’s health issues, particularly cancer. A festive launch event at Belhar’s Airport Mall included an appearance by DJ Ready D, an exhibition of drifting in the parking area in a ManUp-branded car by stunt driver Malikah Daniels, gaming stations and an appearance by Cape Town actor and former Belhar resident Christian Bennett. Bennett has been championing the idea of voluntary circumcision and made headlines in 2017 when he publicly announced he was choosing to get circumcised. “I welcome the launch of this mobile service, especially in the month where we are highlighting the importance of men’s health,” said Western Cape health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo. Zolani Barnes, programme manager for Jhpiego - which is affiliated to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in the US - said the mobile clinic initiative was in support of the health department’s drive “to reach men where they are”. Clinic appointments can be made via WhatsApp on 064877905. Corey Smith is a senior sociology major attending Morehouse College and a part of the SIT Study Abroad Programme with Round Earth Media
