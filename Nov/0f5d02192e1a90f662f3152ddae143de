Could this have been one of the most ill-planned armed robberies Cape Town has ever seen? A 24-year-old man produced a firearm and demanded cash, threatening a minibus taxi driver as he travelled along Buck Road in Grassy Park in the early hours of Monday morning. Seemingly, the man had not devised a suitable plan on where to exit the vehicle after executing the robbery. Unknown to the gunman, his victim drove directly to a place where a large group of fellow taxi drivers had congregated. When the minibus stopped, the gunman was swiftly overpowered and the drivers confiscated his firearm. "The suspect, the 9mm firearm with its serial number filed off, 11 rounds of ammunition and one magazine were handed over to the Grassy Park SAPS," said police spokesperson Capt FC van Wyk. He said the suspect would face charges of kidnapping, possession of an unlicensed firearm, possession of unlicensed ammunition and possession of a prohibited firearm when he appears in the Wynberg Magistrateâ€™s Court.
