The book launch of controversial pastor Prophet Shepherd Bushiri began at 7pm on Tuesday with a performance from a drum band, breaking the long wait endured by guests who were there from before 5pm when the event was scheduled to start. The drummers were joined on stage by five gumboot dancers who performed for a crowd of about 500 guests. Although the programme was supposed to start with the opening prayer at 4.40pm guests had been seated from 5.30pm awaiting the appearance of Bushiri, who had not made an appearance by 7pm. Some of the books to be launched by Bushiri include "Prophetic Codes", "Prophetic Gates", "Sleeping Near the Ark" and "Mysteries Surrounding Your Money". Queues had formed outside the foyer of the Emperor's Palace Convention Centre in Kempton Park earlier on Tuesday afternoon as guests lined up to obtain tickets to attend the launch. The VVIPs, VIPs and diplomats were allowed to enter the hall first, followed by other guests.
