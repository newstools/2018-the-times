Former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan is testifying on Monday at the commission of inquiry into state capture. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo postponed proceedings in October after the commission’s legal team requested that Hogan and current minister Pravin Gordhan be afforded enough time to provide their statements detailing their version of events to implicated parties as per rule three of the commission. Both key witnesses held cabinet positions during the Zuma era. Hogan is expected to shed light on what transpired before she was axed by former president Jacob Zuma in 2010. Hogan is also expected to attest to the pressure she endured by members of the controversial Gupta family and their business associates to scrap a lucrative flight route between Johannesburg and Mumbai. It is believed the Guptas lobbied government officials to drop SAA’s profitable flights between Johannesburg and Mumbai in favour of Jet Airways. Gordhan is expected to testify on Thursday.
