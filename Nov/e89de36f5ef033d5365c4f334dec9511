The Roads Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has welcomed the decision to institute disciplinary action against two medical officers who recorded themselves dancing to the trendy Idibala dance while on duty. In the video that went viral last month, the two officers are seen dancing while driving and not wearing their safety belts. The male and female paramedics can be seen pretending to have fainted as per the #IdibalaChallenge, which has been danced to all over the country. The video was shared multiple times on social media platforms and people loved it. However, the RTMC officers were given a warning following a disciplinary hearing conducted by the Johannesburg Emergency Medical Services. Police had previously warned of the dangers associated with performing the dance while a vehicle was moving. "The RTMC welcomes this decision as the actions of the officers fell below conduct expected of people who work with medical emergencies. Emergency medical personnel routinely respond to road crashes and should, therefore, understand the danger of distracted driving and failure to use safety belts," said RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane. "Section 26, paragraph 3(h) of Emergency Medical Services Regulation of 2017 requires emergency medical services to promote safe driving techniques, as well as awareness of defensive driving techniques," he said. Zwane said the regulations forbid officers’ behaviour "that may reasonably be considered to be bringing the industry into disrepute. "We hope that this sanction will send a strong message to all other public officials to desist from behaviour that compromises safety while driving official state vehicles." He said the public expected officials who represent the state to behave in a manner that is professional and promotes respect for the rules of the road.
