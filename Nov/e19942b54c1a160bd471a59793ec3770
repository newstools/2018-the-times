An eNCA crew was barred from entering a church in KwaZulu-Natal where Minister of Women in the Presidency Bathabile Dlamini was launching the 16 Days of Activism campaign against women and child abuse. The broadcaster reported that its journalist Thubalihle Vilane and camera operator Bongumusa Mkhize were not allowed to enter the church venue in KwaMagwaza in Melmoth on Sunday. eNCA reported that the minister approached the team and told them she was offended at being filmed. After that, her chief of staff, Palesa Mphamo, told the team eNCA should not enter the hall. Also, the minister would only speak to SABC - and not eNCA - because the state broadcaster “knows the parameters”. eNCA said it would seek answers from the government on why this happened.
