Two weeks after their baby girl made her grand entry into the world, Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade have introduced her to fans. Gabrielle announced their little princess' birth through a surrogate on November 9. "This little dynamo reminds me to never give up on my dreams. Never give up hope and never think you are alone. Many people are suffering in silence in plain sight. They are screaming and nothing is coming out. "Let us all remember to keep our eyes, minds and hearts open to one another and for ourselves as well. To anyone suffering and losing hope, let us all lift you up in the light of goodness and hold you there. You are loved, heard and seen," Gabrielle said about her little girl. And her Instagram is also proof that Gabrielle is loving every moment of motherhood. How cute is little Kaavia James Union Wade?
