Former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan is continuing her testimony at the state capture inquiry on Tuesday. In the first day of damning testimony, Hogan pulled former president Jacob Zuma and the ANC squarely into the fray of the state capture inquiry, spelling out startling political interference in the appointment of the Transnet group chief executive officer. Hogan told judge Raymond Zondo how Zuma flouted the law and the constitution by trying to usurp her authority as minister by forcing the appointment of Siyabonga Gama as the CEO of Transnet in 2009, against the recommendation of the parastatal’s board. Hogan also testified how the ANC, the SA Communist Party, the ANC Youth League and trade union Satawu applied public pressure to muscle through Gama’s appointment, despite the fact that he was at the time facing charges of misconduct for tender irregularities. She said the organisations made “false allegations” that Gama was being sidelined because she and the Transnet board wanted to appoint a white candidate when the highly capable Sipho Maseko, now CEO of Telkom, was in fact recommended for the position.
