Just because a lion is a big animal doesn't mean it can't be stealthy. This footage, captured around 20kms fromÂ Malelane Gate in the Kruger National Park on October 16 2018, shows a lioness stalking and killing a kudu. Without making a sound, the lioness carefully manoeuvres through the thicket before chasing and catching the kudu. This is proof that the lion is indeed the king of the jungle.
