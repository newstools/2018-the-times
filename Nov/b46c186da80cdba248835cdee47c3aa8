South Africans were able to cook supper and carry out other homely tasks on Sunday night after Eskom narrowly avoided having to cut power supply to various parts of the country. The national energy utility had earlier on Sunday announced that it would be implementing stage 1 rotational load-shedding, but spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said its team had later saved the day. The power utility implements controlled power cuts to prevent the grid from being overwhelmed. Stage 1 power cuts shed up to 1,000MW from the grid. Eskom, which supplies more than 90% of SA’s power, last week warned of potential outages amid low coal inventories after a major supplier cut supplies and sought insolvency protection.
