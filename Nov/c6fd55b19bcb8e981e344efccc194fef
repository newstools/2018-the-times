Rapper AKA has once again launched an attack on his Twitter critics, telling them they only qualify to give him advice if they are doing better than him. The rapper showed off a new ride this week on social media and wasn't scared to flex on the haters. But, as is always the case, the rapper's followers caught feelings. As fans chipped in with their 2c on everything from his hairstyle to his parenting style and how he should manage his money, the rapper took to Twitter to preach a little. He went on to set a new rule: only open your mouth if you're on his level or higher. He also warned about scare-mongers who want to control through fear.
