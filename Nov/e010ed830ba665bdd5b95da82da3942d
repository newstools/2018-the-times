Two alleged house robbers were shot and killed in a dramatic exchange of gunfire with Marshall Security reaction officers in Durban North on Tuesday. Security officials had reacted to a report of a house robbery in Lansdowne Crescent and as they approached the property, they were fired on by a man armed with an AK-47. Marshall Security spokesman Kyle van Reenen said that they returned fire. “Officers returned fire and a shootout ensued. The suspect armed with an AK-47 was fatally wounded on scene whilst his accomplices fled in a Mercedes-Benz getaway vehicle.” Another alleged robber was found dead in their getaway car, which was abandoned in a nearby cemetery. Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed that two men were killed and that police were investigating.
