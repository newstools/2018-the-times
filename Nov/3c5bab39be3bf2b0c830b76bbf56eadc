A policeman is alleged to have shot and killed a woman and a man before turning the gun on himself in a dramatic double murder suicide, which played out in the Durban Regional court on Monday. Sources with knowledge of the incident, who spoke to TimesLIVE on condition of anonymity, said that a man believed to be a Saps officer had entered the court precinct with a gun. It is understood that the gunman spread of a barrage of gunfire in O-court on the building’s 8th floor. The woman is believed to have been the gunman's wife. The shooting is believed to have taken place while the court was out of session and the sitting magistrate had taken tea. Visibly shaken court staff, including clerks and interpreters, were seen escorted from the building by medics to waiting ambulances. Paramedics and heavily armed police officers streamed into the Durban Regional court building while security officials barred the public from entering. The critically injured gunman was rushed from the scene in an ambulance to a hospital on Durban’s Ridge. A second man was transported by Rescue Care paramedics to another Durban hospital.
