Singer Rihanna has joined musicians who have spoken out against President Donald Trump playing their songs at his rallies.The pop singer responded to a tweet by a Washington Post journalist who said that Rihanna's Don't stop the music was playing at a Trump rally in Chattanooga. According to the New York Times, the singer's lawyer sent a cease and desist letter to the White House Council arguing that Rihanna did not give consent for Trump to use her music. Music licensing organisations in the US have now allowed for musicians to deny certain people and groups from playing their songs at political campaigns.Guns 'n Roses band member, Axl Rose also spoke out on the matter after being informed  the band's song Sweet Child was played at a Trump rally. Axl Rose claimed that musicians do not have full control of who can play their music. Celebrities in the US often openly declare their support for a party and political candidate. They have argued that using their music may be seen as an endorsement. Pharrell Williams and Steven Tyler also sent letters to Trump to order him to stop using their music.Music is licensed by organisations such as the BMI and ASCAP under the US copyright law. In order to play sound recordings at restaurants, hotels, grocery stores and other public venues,  a public performance licence is required.
