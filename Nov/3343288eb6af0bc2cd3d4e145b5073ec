At the beginning of November, Malusi Gigaba did a series of interviews to defend himself against what he called a "political conspiracy" that sought to see him out of a job. In the days leading up to the interviews, Gigaba was embroiled in a sex tape scandal and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said he lied under oath. Despite the calls for his head, Gigaba maintained that he would not resign. Interview clips of Gigaba saying he would stay in his office have since re-emerged on social media. On November 13 Gigaba handed in his resignation to President Cyril Ramaphosa. In a statement released by Gigaba after the Presidency confirmed that he had resigned, Gigaba said his decision should not be seen as an admission of guilt. While there were calls for Gigaba to leave, shock over the decision was rife, considering how Gigaba had insisted just a week before that he would stay.
