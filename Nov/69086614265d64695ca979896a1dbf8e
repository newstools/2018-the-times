A former human resources manager from a Barberton mine was arrested after he managed to defraud the SA Revenue Service (Sars) of almost R2m. "It is alleged that between 2011 and 2014, Thomi Mduduzi Masango submitted falsified tax return claims to Sars on behalf of workers. Sars lost approximately R1.9m as a result of the accused’s illegal activities," said Hawks spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi. The 41-year-old was charged with 41 counts of fraud. He appeared in the Barberton Magistrate's Court earlier this week, where he was granted bail of R5,000. The case was remanded to December 4 for further investigation.
