Zodwa Wabantu has been accused of making her Ben 10 Ntobeko Linda her "handbag" because he's always with her, but the entertainer has explained that it's all part of her trying to give as much time to her job as her relationship. The first thing Zodwa wants Mzansi to understand is that she's wasn't willing to mess with her hustle for love but she was also at a point in her life where she didn't want to compromise her love for money. "I'm a very busy woman and as a woman many people might even say I'm selfish because I am always working, you know in demand. But what I try to do now is to ensure that every second I have to attend to my boyfriend or my son, I do so. Hence people will see us all the time together. It's not that I take him to work, it's that whenever I am free I am with him," Zodwa told TshisaLIVE. Zodwa explained that she was never a fan of mixing business with pleasure. However, at times the perks of her job allowed her to experience new things with her boo and he tags along. "My boyfriend is not a handbag; why should he go everywhere I go? No, work is work and home is home. Just like any job sometimes they sponsor my trips to places I've never been before like Zambia and then I take him along because he's never been there and I've never been there. It becomes an experience we share. As long as it's sponsored why should he stay behind and miss an opportunity to experience something new?" Zodwa explained that it was love for her job, her bae and her son that helped her create and maintain a balance of her time. Still, she always makes times for herself. "I am my number priority. I know that always sound wrong when I say it because I am a mother and a girlfriend. But what I mean is I put myself, my health and sanity first because when I'm happy then the people around me will be happy too.
