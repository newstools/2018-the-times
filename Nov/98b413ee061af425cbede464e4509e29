A family that shops together stays together. Lungile Nxumalo and her five sisters travelled 45 minutes from Inchanga, west of Durban, to join hundreds of eager Black Friday shoppers at Game Pavilion, in Westville. "We sat down as family, put money together and planned what we were going to buy," said Nxumalo. Among the family's haul were fridges, televisions and washing powder, which they planned to split among themselves. Nxumalo, who arrived at 5am, said they had a shopping strategy. "Some have gone to withdraw money, while others are waiting in line for fridges," said Nxumalo, whose duty was to man the trolley. Also standing in line to purchase a fridge was Mzandile Jali, who said: "I have been here since 5am. I want to buy a fridge for the December holidays." It was relatively calm at Game, as shoppers patiently waited in line to get a numbered ticket before proceeding to a payment line. They will have to wait until Monday for their goods to be delivered. "I donâ€™t mind waiting until Monday because I am going on holiday," said Natalie Pather, who took the day off to take advantage of Black Friday specials. A store employee said the hot ticket this year was a Defy chest freezer.
