Bonang Matheba was recently honoured with the first ever 5 For Change Award for making a difference through the Bonang Matheba Bursary Fund. Shortly after the awards last weekend B also revealed that in 2019, she will be able to send 10 more girls to university after she partnered with an organisation that is yet to be revealed. "Wanna know why I’m smiling so hard? Because in 2019, 10 MORE South African girls will receive the incredible opportunity of going to university! I’ve partnered with an incredible organisation who believe in my passion of educating the African girl child." Of course Bonang also rocked the red carpet in an embellished ball gown that oozed class.
