A Dutch pensioner is going to court to in an effort to have has age changed from 69 to 49. Emile Ratelband told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, "You can change your name. You can change your gender. Why not your age? "When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer. When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position." Ratelband said that according to his doctors he has the body of a 45-year-old, and described himself as a "young god". The BBC reported a court will rule on the matter within a month.
