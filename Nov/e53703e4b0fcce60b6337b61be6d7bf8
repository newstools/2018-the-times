After hinting for some time that she's ready to play a role in a Ferguson Film's production, Zodwa Wabantu is now taking matters into her own hand and posting "auditions" online. Of course that's not how it works. There's a casting call and agents get their stars to go for auditions, or there's an open call for actors. But there have been exceptional cases and that is exactly what Zodwa is planning to be: an exceptional case. "Everybody know by now that I love acting. I never had the opportunities to go to school for it but I know of many great actors that also didn't. All they did was put in the work and they learnt on the job. I know I can be that as well. I just need a chance," Zodwa told TshisaLIVE. Zodwa said is dedicating 2019 to establishing herself as an actress, come rain or sunshine. Keeping in line with that goal, Zodwa thought she'd get an early start and start knocking on the Ferguson's doors. "I always tag Connie in my posts. I would really love to work with her and her husband. I won't give up because that's where I want to end up." Watch her in action below.Â Do you think she has what it takes to go Hollywood?
