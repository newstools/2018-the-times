Public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan gave his much-awaited testimony before the Zondo commission this week. Here are five key articles that you should read on his appearance before the commission, which is investigating allegations of state capture. Sassa grants debacle People who followed the social grants saga closely were not surprised that Bathabile Dlamini was mentioned during Gordhan's testimony at the state capture inquiry. In 2016, Dlamini, in her capacity as social development minister at the time, reached out to former president Jacob Zuma to complain about decisions taken by National Treasury in relation to the payment of grants. Gordhan detailed the events and decisions that led to Dlamini scripting that lengthy note. Pressure from all sides Regarding the 2016 closure of Gupta company bank accounts, Gordhan testified that politicians and business associates of the family pressured him to negotiate with the financial institutions on behalf of the Gupta family. EFF protests While the former finance minister was helping the commission to "connect the dots" inside the Hill on Empire building where the inquiry was held, the EFF protested outside. The red berets accused Gordhan of being a corrupt liar. Meetings with the Guptas Perhaps the most anticipated part of Gordhan's testimony was his response to claims that he had held meetings with the Guptas. He elaborated on the response he gave in parliament back in 2016, when the DA asked him about such meetings. Tenders for family members The EFF has repeatedly said that Gordhan should be investigated for tenders that were allegedly awarded to his daughter. When he wrapped up his testimony, Gordhan took the opportunity to tackle those allegations.
