Hammanskraal celebrated the opening of a new cinema last week which will bring old movie classics and the latest blockbusters closer to the people. BornStar Cinema at The Carousel boasts two movie houses - one for golden oldies and another for new movie releases. This translates into a platform for local content producers to showcase their movie productions. According to a media statement announcing the launch, BornStar Cinema's also aims to "encourage young people to pursue their movie-making aspirations and take part in telling their own stories." BornStar Cinema's Nelson Mhlolo says opening day gave people who had never been to a cinema before experience the big screen for the first time. "There are young children and old people who are very happy that they didn't have to travel far from home to have fun." The cinema has also created job opportunities for people living in the area. "Through our promise to employ local people from the area at the cinema and refreshment outlet, as well as by giving local producers a platform to screen their creations, we hope to impact positively on the surrounding community," said Mhlolo. *Patrons do not have to pay The Carousel entrance fee to get into the cinema. They can buy tickets at the gate.
