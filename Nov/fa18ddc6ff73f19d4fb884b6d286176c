Can you believe that it's been two years since that 'Homewrecker Penguin' broke the internet? At the time the incident was the most interesting nature provided scandal we've ever seen and this week when the two-year anniversary of the internet breaking video came by, Twitter went into memory lane. National Geographic shared a video on Twitter in 2016 showing a group of penguins. The narrator began the story by explaining that every September these penguins flock to a place where they fix up their nests and breed. While many of them were enjoying the "good life" there was one who wasn't. “This husband has come home to find his wife with another penguin,” the narrator explains, as the clip shows a male penguin coming across the new coupling. “He flips out. His strategy is simple: Batter the home-wrecker until he flees.” What followed was a heartbreaking bloody fight between the hubby penguin and the homewrecker penguin.
