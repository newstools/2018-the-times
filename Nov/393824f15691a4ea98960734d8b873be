A 47-year-old mentally impaired man from Modimolle in Limpopo, accused of raping a teenager who was also mentally impaired, has been released without bail. Police said that social workers were first alerted of the alleged rape in June. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said community members informed social workers that the man was suspected of raping the then teenager in 2014, resulting in her falling pregnant. The woman, who is now 18, has a four-year-old child. "The matter was immediately reported to the social worker who opened the case on behalf of the victim. The initial investigations by the police ensued and subsequently, the suspect who is also mentally disabled, was arrested," said Ngoepe. The matter was heard in the Mokgopoong Magistrate's Court on Friday and has since been postponedÂ to January 22, pending further police investigation.
