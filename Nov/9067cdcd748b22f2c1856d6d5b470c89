Free State police have opened an enquiry after the popular Cubana club in Bloemfontein was gutted by fire at about 10am this morning. Police spokesperson Constable Wendy Nkabi said one of the workers allegedly heard an explosion and when they investigated, they saw fire which spread quickly. “Within minutes the Cubana building in Westdene was engulfed by fire. No one was injured,” said Nkabi. She said police had opened an enquiry. The popular restaurant and nightclub in Westdene’s President Reitz Avenue in Bloemfontein's CBD was busy on Friday night as it hosted DJs Soul Cue & Tiger and a number of other entertainers. On Saturday it was expected to be packed to capacity as Absolute DJ and Hlokozanesty were to share the stage. The club has a popular VIP lounge that is normally reserved for the wealthy tenderpreneurs. Videos circulating showed Mangaung Metro firefighters extinguishing the fire and a street in front of the club was cordoned off. The building was completely destroyed by the blaze. People started posting the pictures and videos of the blaze on social media. Some showed their unhappiness, asking why Cubana would burn at festive time. Arrive Alive also posted on its Twitter page that the venue had been destroyed after an explosion. @Johrne tweeted: "#Cubana #Bloemfontein destroyed. Real time tweet." One social media user questioned why the building was burnt down, as the fire department was only five minutes away from Cubana. Cubana management and the Mangaung fire department could not be reached for comment.
