For years trolls have had a field day hurling insults at Kelly Khumalo but she's evidently gatvol and has unleashed the clapback queen. It's evident that gone are the days where Kelly will bite her tongue and let people drag her reputation through the mud. The songstress has become a major talking point and a target of cyberbullies after loved-up snaps of her and Chad da Don have emerged on social media. But Kelly has a strong message for all you trolls! "Not this time my love cyberbullying must stop, these cowards get away with it cause they know that we will ignore or walk away. Not this time," Kelly told a fan who advised her to take the higher road and ignore trolls. Kelly who has been considered to be unlucky in love has for years been blamed for the "ill-fate" of her exes. Ever since it emerged that she and Chad could be romantically linked, trolls have been telling the rapper he's doomed. However, Kelly is spitting fire and will not tolerate such. The Unleashed hitmaker went on to explain that she's made a decision not to let trolls off the hook anymore and this was a battle she was intending to win, nomakanjani! Kelly has declared war! "Oh this time they have my undivided attention. I've never been a push over and Iâ€™m not about to start now. This is one battle I intend on winning! #CyberBullyingMustStop" Y'all better stop with this trolling Kelly nonsense now. Clearly she's unleashed her inner clapback queen and she'll hurt your egos. This will be you...
