EFF leader Julius Malema is opening a criminal case against public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan. Malema's move comes after Gordhan laid charges of crimen injuria, incitement of violence and criminal defamation against the EFF leader. Gordhan laid the charges at the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria. This came after statements made by Malema last week outside the state capture inquiry in Johannesburg where scores of EFF members protested while Gordhan testified before the Zondo commission.
