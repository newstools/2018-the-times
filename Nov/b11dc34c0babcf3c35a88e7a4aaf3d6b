Public enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan will continue testifying at the state capture inquiry on Tuesday. It is expected Gordhan will disclose details of any meetings with the Guptas. On Monday, Gordhan said securing a nuclear procurement deal became then-president Jacob Zuma’s central focus after he was re-elected in 2014. Gordhan, who was describing his former stint as finance minister to the state capture inquiry on Monday, said the implications for South Africans should the deal have gone through would have been “quite serious”. He said it became evident that the former president and the department of energy were pursuing the controversial 2011 deal with the Russians at all costs. He also testified that Zuma was hellbent on appointing Tom Moyane as commissioner of revenue service Sars despite being advised that there were more credible candidates suitable for the job. As Gordhan testified the members of the EFF and BLF gathered outside the building in Parktown to protest, calling on Gordhan to resign. EFF deputy Floyd Shivambu warned that Gordhan would fall. "In the same way we removed Jacob Zuma, in the same way we removed Nhlanhla Nene, you are next, we are going to remove you," said Shivambu as he addressed EFF supporters, who have promised to return on Tuesday.
