Don't delete that Pinterest board with all your Halloween costume ideas just yet — it might come in handy when you're planning what to wear to Comic Con Africa 2019. After the success of the inaugural Comic Con Africa earlier this year, the good people at Reed Exhibitions Africa and ReedPOP have already started planning the second edition of this popular event. They've announced that Comic Con Africa 2019 will take place from September 21 to 24 at a new venue: Gallagher Convention Centre in Midrand, Johannesburg. "The 2018 event welcomed 45,085 visitors ... but sadly we sold out before the event started and we want to make sure that in 2019 we can offer this experience to many more people. The new venue gives us this option, with a capacity of over 80,000 people,” says Carol Weaving, Managing Director of Reed Exhibitions. They've also extended the festivities by making next year's Comic Con Africa a four-day event. Tickets will go on sale from the end of November.
