Black Leopards travel to Cape Town this weekend seeking to turn their attacking performances into much-needed points and get themselves away from the Absa Premiership’s relegation zone. Their match against Cape Town City at Cape Town Stadium on Sunday promises to be an all-action affair but for the newly-promoted team’s coach‚ Joel Masutha‚ points are now becoming essential. Leopards sit just two points above the relegation zone with only two wins from their opening 10 games of the league season – one-third of the way through the campaign already – which Masutha believes is not just reward for some good performances. They outshone Kaizer Chiefs away at FNB Stadium on Wednesday but still lost 1-0. “I don’t want to talk about luck as everyone needs to create their own luck‚ but things have not been going our way‚” Masutha said. Masutha has joined the chorus of top-flight coaches bemoaning poor finishing. But he prefers the psychology of encouragement and will be doing so again as Leopards ready for their match in Cape Town. “I always preach to my players that they must never stop believing. When I started with the team last season we were 12th or 13th on the log in the NFD‚ but I told them we could go up and get promotion. “Things can happen in football all the time‚ is what I still keep telling them. We are a brave team that doesn’t know how to park the bus. I tell them to be positive at all times. We have to keep looking forward‚” the coach added. Masutha said playing on the slick Cape Town Stadium pitch would be a boost to their chances. “We love playing on these high quality pitches. For us to come from the NFD and to play at venues like FNB is a massive boost for our players‚” he said. “In Cape Town we are also going to try and enjoy the occasion. We know that Cape Town City play well at home but we believe we can take them.” PSL this weekend Friday: Saturday: Sunday:
