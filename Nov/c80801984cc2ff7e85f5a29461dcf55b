The 68-year-old has since been arrested, said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "This follows an incident that occurred on November 20 at around 4pm at Maake outside Tzaneen where the suspect ... lured her to his house and raped her. He then offered her a packet of chips in exchange for her silence," said Ngoepe. "The parents of the child, Â after noticing the changes in the behaviour of the victim, questioned her and she divulged the whole ordeal." A case was opened and the man was arrested at his home.
