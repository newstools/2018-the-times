A security guard was wounded in an exchange of gunfire with robbers in a cash-in-transit heist in Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, on Saturday morning. SABC news reported that the suspects used explosives to force the cash-in-transit van open before escaping in two bakkies with an undisclosed amount of money. It said that according to witnesses, a Mercedes-Benz vehicle was used to intercept the van that was transporting the money. The report quoted police spokesman Vish Naidoo as saying: “Security guards did try to put up a fight. There was an exchange of gunfire between them and the robbers. But unfortunately they were overpowered by the robbers who came in two other bakkies. “They were armed with rifles and machine guns. They then used explosives to gain access to the money in the vehicle and fled with an undisclosed amount of money. One security guard is reportedly wounded from the exchange of gunfire and has been taken to hospital where he is reported to be in a stable condition.”
