Limpopo police have launched a manhunt for suspects involved in an attempted robbery that resulted in a multiple vehicle accident that claimed the lives of five people in the early hours of Saturday. The victims were killed when their vehicle slammed into the back of a truck whose driver was being robbed by unknown suspects on the N1 South and two other vehicles then went into the back of them. “On Saturday at about 2.30am, a truck allegedly experienced mechanical problems and stopped next to the road along the N1 between Modimolle Mountain and Kranskop Tollgate. Two suspects suddenly emerged and attempted to rob the driver. “The truck driver immediately pulled off and as he got onto the road, a Toyota vehicle drove into the truck from behind. The robbers fired shots at the direction of the truck driver who did not stop, but proceeded straight to Naboomspruit police station. The occupants of the Toyota were in the process of getting out of the vehicle when two other vehicles slammed into them, killing five people on impact,” police said. They said that following the incident, provincial police commissioner for Limpopo Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba had established a special task team to “deal with criminal activities that appear to be taking root along the N1 south of Polokwane”. “As we approach the festive period, people will be travelling to various destinations and we urge everyone to practice safety and remain vigilant at all times, especially at night. Criminals often take advantage of the night and target motorists who sometimes stop alongside the road,” Ledwaba cautioned.
