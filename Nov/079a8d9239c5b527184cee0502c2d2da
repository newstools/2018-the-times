The man photographed "dangling" a dog from a moving car in a picture that was widely spread on social media says he was in fact trying to prevent the pooch from jumping out of the car. This emerged when the man was interviewed by police after a case of animal cruelty was opened on Wednesday. The driver who photographed the incident has also given a statement to police. The incident happened in Mohammed Desai Road, Fairview. Police spokesperson Col Priscilla Naidu said the driver went to the Walmer police station where he gave police a statement. “It has emerged that the driver was on his way home when his children called him saying that the dogs had escaped. He saw the dogs while driving home and put them into his car,” she said. “While driving, one dog jumped out of the car window and the driver managed to grab it by the leg to stop it from landing in the road.” The driver in the car behind managed to photograph the incident. “The man who took the picture stopped alongside the car and spoke to the driver, who explained that the dog had tried to jump out of the car window. They then put the dog in the boot,” she said. “They then went their separate ways. For some reason, the man who took the picture went ahead and put it on social media. Obviously people saw this and assumed animal abuse without knowing the full story.” Police launched an investigation after the picture spread on social media on Wednesday. “A man who saw the picture, but was not a witness to the incident, opened a criminal case based on the image alone," Naidu said. Naidu said that while the two versions corresponded, the case — which has been finalised — would still be sent to the senior public prosecutor for a decision on whether to prosecute.
