A suspect was shot dead by police during a car chase on Saturday after he and his accomplices allegedly robbed the Manganeng Clinic in Ga-Sekhukhuni in Limpopo. Police said a manhunt was under way for two other suspects who had fled to the mountains. “Members of the K9 have been activated and are also assisting in tracing these suspects,” police said. The robbery was the latest in a spate of armed robberies reported at hospitals and clinics in the province in the past few days, one of which left three doctors wounded. The doctors were shot when heavily armed men burst into their residence at Letaba Hospital in Limpopo during a robbery early on Thursday. The provincial health department said in a series of tweets that witnesses reported that five heavily armed men speaking in a foreign language had carried out the robbery. Limpopo police spokesperson colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the doctors were asleep when the group of men broke in. The robbers stole cellphones, televisions, laptops and cash. Police also reported a robbery at the Lebowakgomo Hospital. They are investigating cases of attempted murder and house robbery. On Saturday police said they were offering a reward of up to R100,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators. Limpopo police commissioner lieutenant-general Nneke Ledwaba said a special task team had been established to investigate the robberies. “I have instructed members of this team to hunt down all perpetrators involved and bring them to book. I also call upon community members to come forward with information that can lead to the arrest of these criminals,” Ledwaba said.
