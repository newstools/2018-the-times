Lillian Dube has slammed people who made light of her comments about vibrators and "sucking titties", telling TshisaLIVE that social media can be "a b*tch" sometimes. Lillian found herself making headlines in August when she joked in an interview with City Press that she owned seven vibrators. She later laughed it off and said she actually only owned three. A few weeks after that interview Lillian became the talk of social media when a clip of her telling SABC host Thomas Mlambo about "sucking titties" to detect breast cancer went viral. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, she said the strong response from social media came from those who were immature and ignorant. "I was misunderstood. Social media is a b*tch. I was misunderstood. It is about early detection. The thing is, once you know your truth. It is enough." Lillian said that the backlash even came from within her own family with some enquiring how her grandchildren would react to their gran speaking about vibrators. "My granddaughter's stepfather said to his wife (the mother of my grandchild), 'Wow! Lesedi's grandmother is talking about vibrators. How will Lesedi react? She said Lillian has always been like this, it is nothing new and she won't be bothered." Lillian also hit back at a TV host who said they had lost respect for Ma after her comments. "They have insulted me, this boy said; 'I have always had respect for Ma Lillian Dube, but now I don't know how I can look at you.' I said poor boy! He is misinformed. Sweetie, I speak my mind and I speak about vibrators." Lillian said all she wanted was to make people laugh and if it was not for her thick skin she would have given up on life a long time ago. "If I had listened to anyone, I could have crawled under a table. But I know that I am very special and God made me this way. "
