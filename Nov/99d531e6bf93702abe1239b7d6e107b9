An international financial monitoring organisation has revealed how tax dodgers robbed the SA economy of an estimated $37bn (R550bn). Its report says that from 2010 to 2014 the economy lost on average an estimated $7.4bn (R111bn) annually through misinvoicing â€“ a form of tax fraud which, according to a tax lawyer, the taxman has been battling for years to clamp down on.
