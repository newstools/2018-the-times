Some of South Africa’s most prolific writers and poets took to the stage on Sunday evening to launch Reclaiming Agency 2018, an initiative to start a dialogue about racial identity and civil society finding a voice to oppose corruption. “We live in a society where the possibility of consequence is remote,” said poet and activist Zenzile Khoisan, who is among a host of reputable panelists who will take part in the discussions over the next two days in Cape Town. Through these discussions "we aim to find ourselves in truth and embrace the beauty in each other. If SA is going to wake up and take control, we need a true revival," he said. Former Western Cape leader of union federation Cosatu Tony Ehrenreich called for renewed vigour in conversations about race, as he welcomed NGOs, higher-education institutions, artists, poets, researchers, authors and social activists at the Old Granery building, home to an exhibition of writing by former archbishop Desmond Tutu. A spokesperson from the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation said the discussions would be a critical exercise for civil society to engage in robust conversation about "who we are and how we can collectively assert action". The  busy programme includes a book market, open mic sessions, poetry workshops and various discussions tackling a range of issues that focus on race in SA. Reclaiming Agency 2018 is an initiative of Cornerstone Institute, in partnership with the Desmond and Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation, the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation (IJR), District Six Museum, Guga Sthebe Arts & Culture Centre, Community Chest and Catholic Welfare & Development Athlone Cultural Hub. All events are free and open to the public.
