Fam! Where do we find a guy like J'Something? The musician wears his heart on his sleeve and isn't shy to flaunt it. J'Something and his wife, Coco are loving every moment of their journey as a married couple. The Mi Casa frontman once again poured his heart out about the way his queen makes him feel. "We were born to learn to love. All of us! None of us know how to love perfectly. Only God does. God is love. But that’s the purpose behind life, for us to learn and practice love with one another so that we can learn so much more about who God is! When I found this lady of mine I knew I wanted to learn to love her. I wanted to practice patience with her. I wanted to put aside my pride for her. I wanted to learn to forgive her. I wanted to be kind to her and show her that she could trust me every second of the day. "Each day we get stronger and that’s what being a couple is about  and I just dig that we know how to have a good time." Guys we hope you're taking notes!
