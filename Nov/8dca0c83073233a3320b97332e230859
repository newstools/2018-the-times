"We are here to expose you!" These were the words of EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu outside the venue where public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan appeared at the state capture inquiry. Protesters from the EFF and the Black First Land First (BLF) movement gathered outside the commission of inquiry into state capture calling for Gordhan to resign. "In the same way we removed Jacob Zuma, in the same way we removed Nhlanhla Nene, you are next, we are going to remove you," said Shivambu as he addressed EFF supporters.
