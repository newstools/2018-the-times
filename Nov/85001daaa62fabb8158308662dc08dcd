Lerato Sengadi's decision to take HHP's family to court in an attempt to halt his funeral, which was set to take place on November 3 has sparked massive Twitter reaction, landing her name in the trends list. HHP died on Wednesday October 24 in a suspected suicide after a lengthy battle with depression. At the Johannesburg memorial service, which was held in HHP's honour on Tuesday, Lerato took to the stage to share a tribute that also had some strong comments about a battle she was about to fight. "As Jabba's lawful customary wife, it is my right to make the necessary funeral arrangements for his burial and to play an integral part in all of the actions and proceedings in relation thereto. I have been deprived of this right. I have simply and without cause been prevented by the respondent from fulfilling my role as customary wife," eNCA reports. It seems the battle that Lerato Sengadi hinted at in her tribute to the late rapper on Tuesday would happen sooner that expected as news have just emerged that Lerato has filed a motion to halt HHP's funeral. Here are some reactions.
