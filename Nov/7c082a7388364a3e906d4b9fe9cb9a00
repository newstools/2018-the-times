To make it a fair tasting, we purchased iced fruit cakes from five leading retailers and gathered a group of home bakers for a blind tasting. All the cakes were stripped of their packaging and numbered before being served to the tasters, who rated them on appearance, aroma, taste, and whether they would buy them. Auditor Jade Craig checked the scores and collated the results.
