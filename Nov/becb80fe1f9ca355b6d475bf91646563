Limpopo police are offering a reward of up to R100,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrators of an attack on three doctors during a robbery at the Letaba Hospital and another robbery at the Lebowakgomo Hospital. Three doctors were shot when heavily armed men burst into their residence at Letaba Hospital in Limpopo during a robbery early on Thursday. Photographs of the crime scene showed a broken window and what appeared to be blood and a discarded shoe in the living area of the residence. One of the victims, a woman, was taken to hospital in a critical condition and was to undergo surgery. A two-month-old baby was unharmed during the shooting. The provincial health department said in a series of tweets that witnesses reported that five heavily armed men speaking in a foreign language had carried out the robbery. Limpopo police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said the doctors were asleep when the group of men broke in. They stole cellphones, televisions, laptops and cash. Police are investigating cases of attempted murder and house robbery. “The provincial commissioner, Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has already put into action the 72-hour action plan to hunt down these criminals. The Provincial Task Team led by a major-general has been hard at work, searching for the suspects who attacked the Doctors at Letaba Hospital. The same task team will also take over the investigation of this latest house robbery at Lebowakgomo hospital. “Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of the suspects is requested to contact Brigadier James Esbach at 082 576 0743 or Captain Richard Boshomane at 079 894 5501, or call the toll free number 0860010111 or contact the nearest police. Any information received will be treated with the strictest confidentiality,” Limpopo police said in a statement on Saturday.
