A grade one learner has been stabbed to death in Makapanstad, North West, allegedly by a learner from another school Basic education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon that the “tragic incident” happened at the Dikeledi Makapan Primary School earlier that morning. “A grade one learner was stabbed multiple times, allegedly by a grade 11 learner from another school, Mankala Technical High School, who had been hiding in the primary school’s toilet,” Mhlanga said. “It is alleged that the suspect apparently slept in the toilet overnight without anyone knowing he was there. The deceased was one of the first to go to the toilet in the morning and the grade 11 learner allegedly repeatedly stabbed him. He was rushed to the local clinic where he was sadly certified dead.” The school principal apprehended the alleged perpetrator and handed him over to the police. “It appears the suspect knew the deceased, and it is alleged that he was in a romantic relationship with the grade one learner’s older sister, who also attends Mankala Technical High School with the suspect," said Mhlanga. He added that the couple may have had a fallout and the alleged perpetrator had targeted the younger brother. “[The] police will conduct a full investigation around the circumstance of this horrific murder.” North West education MEC Jonas Sello Lehari and the basic education department’s director of school safety, Paseka Njobe, will visit the school on Thursday.
