Media mogul Oprah Winfrey's emotionalÂ speech during Georgia candidate, Stacey Abrams' campaign last week, got a mixed reaction on social media. While some were inspired by the speech, other's were all about that "this ain't Hollywood, O" idea. Oprah is no stranger to publicly endorsing political candidates. In 2008, she campaigned for former US President Barack Obama as well Hillary Clinton in 2016. She is one of many celebrities who have come out in support of Abrams including John Legend, rapper Common and actor Will Ferrell.Taking into account the historical voting patterns and the representation of African Americans in USA politics, Abrams' campaign has drawn much public attention. ''When I go to the polls, I cast a vote for my grandmother who died in 1963 before the voting rights act of 1965 and never had the chance to vote," Winfrey said.The TV mogul went on a door-to-door Georgia last week to campaign for Abrams. Winfrey again dismissed rumours that she intended on running for president in 2020, "I don't want to run,okay? I'm not trying to test any waters," she said. So, why is Abrams getting Oprah's approval? Abrams is up against Republican candidate Brian Kemp in the race to become the governor of Georgia in the gubernatorial elections. If she wins the electionsAbrams will be the first African American female governor in the history of the USA.However, not everyone was moved by Oprah's decision to publicly endorse a political candidate. ''This aint Hollywood. This is Georgia," US Vice President, Mike Pence said at a campaign event for Abram's opponent Kemp. Twitter, however, was inspired by Oprah's endorsement and gave her decision to back Abram's the thumbs-up.
