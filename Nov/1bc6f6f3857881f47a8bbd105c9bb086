The body of a man was found floating in the Emmarentia Dam in Johannesburg on Monday afternoon. Police captain Kay Makhubele said the police were alerted at around 2:30pm. "The body was discovered by a passerby who said he saw it floating in the dam," said Makhubele. "It was badly decomposed," he added. Police divers were called to retrieve the body. Northcliff Melville Times reported that Louw Geldenhuys Drive was closed after the grim discovery. The dam is just a few kilometres from the city centre. It is a popular family destination and is used for rowing, sailing of small boats and paddling canoes. The area is also popular among joggers and dog walkers. Makhubele could not immediately give further details. Foul play has not been ruled out.
