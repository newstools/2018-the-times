Y'all are sleeping on ProVerb and after he's gone, you'll be ouchea saying he was the one of the greatest to ever do it. This 18-year-old video is all the proof you need. Plus it might be worth listening to the guy since he "predicted" the petrol hike and stuff. Back in 2000, when Vico Mash was a slender with blonde hair and Rudeboy Paul had dreadlocks, ProKid was one of the contestants on a show called Jam Alley. Now, the 2000s must just sit down because they will know nothing about this. But for the rest of us, before we had things like Live Amp and Club 808, we had Jam Alley. It was a popular youth show and our version of a variety show. Young people with the ambition to be "someone" in the industry tested the water on that stage and back in 2000, ProVerb took that chance. Can we just take a moment to thank God for glow up? Look at that leather jacket fam. And how about that beanie looking thing. Either way, the boy had bars for days. And while it's worth noting that ProVerb has been having doing the most for a long time on the mic, tweeps were more worried about his petrol predictions. *Is there a prophetic/ancestral something you wanna share Pro?* Petrol prophesy aside, Pro has done good for himself. And hey, at least the petrol also affects him - because a whole Porsche?
