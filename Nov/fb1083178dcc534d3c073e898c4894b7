It seems like one of the new age requirements to be president of Mzansi is you have to be a beast on the dance floor like it's Jika Majika up in here and following in the footsteps of Msholozi President Cyril Ramaphosa isn't doing too badly. Remember how he burst onto the dance scene with his moves in Limpopo earlier this year? Well the country's number one has upgraded to international performances now. The president attended the Africa Investment Forum at the Sandton Convention Centre this week where he not only gave a strong address to world leaders but also schooled some heads of state on the dancefloor. Cava: It wasn't quite the vosho or Walwede faint but the president sure showed up. He was applauded by not only those on the dancefloor but also by the Twitter masses who poured onto the presidency's official Twitter page to rate his moves.
