Following days of outrage, insurance company Momentum has changed its policies to pay out death benefits in the case of a violent crime, despite the medical history of the person. This comes after the widow of hijacking victim Nathan Ganas was denied a life cover payout of R2.4m. Momentum took the initial decision on the grounds that the deceased had not disclosed a pre-existing medical condition. The decision sparked a backlash on social media, with many threatening to cancel their policies with the insurer. The new solution will apply to all existing and future Momentum clients. Momentum is also identifying previous clients who were subject to the same claim as the Ganas family. The new development drew mixed reactions on Twitter, with many acknowledging the role of social media in pushing the case.
