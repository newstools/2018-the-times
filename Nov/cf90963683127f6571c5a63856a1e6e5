"I am not Nelson Mandela, neither am I [Jacob] Zuma. If you push me, I push back." These were the words of EFF leader Julius Malema outside the Brooklyn police station in Pretoria as he laid charges of fraud, perjury and corruption against public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan on Tuesday. Malema said witnesses at the state capture inquiry should not be intimidated, but the EFF would continue to criticise certain politicians that took part. "But that does not mean politics is over in South Africa. The Zondo Commission does not mean the end of politics, and therefore no one... can stop us from criticising politicians." Malema was at the police station a day after Gordhan laid charges of crimen injuria, incitement of violence and criminal defamation against the EFF leader.
