A drug laboratory has been found on the property of a well-known former Kaizer Chiefs striker. Police descended on the plot in Hillside on the West Rand, which also has a livestock farm, in the early hours of Wednesday, and found a mandrax manufacturing plant, the Sowetan reported on Thursday. National police spokesperson Col Brenda Muridili confirmed to the newspaper that the former footballer had been arrested. Three men found on the plot were also arrested, she said. In a statement, the police's acting national commissioner, Lieutenant General Stefan Schutte, commended Crime Intelligence, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation and the Gauteng Province Anti-Gang Unit for the discovery of the clandestine drug laboratory. He praised the team for cutting off the supply of drugs to South Africa's children. "Drugs ravage our communities and destroy the future of our children. As we will soon commemorate the 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Children, we all need to take extra care of our children by ridding our communities of drugs," said Lt Gen Schutte. He urged communities to become part of community policing forums. Muridili said the multi-disciplinary team had observed the smallholding for a period of time until they were satisfied that they had enough evidence to apply for a search warrant. The team discovered a steel shed full of chemicals and machines used to manufacture mandrax as well as a truck containing liquid chemical, she said. "The value of the clandestine drug laboratory will be determined by Forensics as soon as they are done with their analyses," she added. The suspects are facing a charge of manufacturing drugs. The case will be investigated by the Hawks.
