Former mineral resources minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi described the tenure of former president Jacob Zuma as "the season of madness". Ramatlhodi made these assertions at the Zondo commission of inquiry on Wednesday when he appeared to make his submissions. The former minister didn't mince his words at the commission adding that the ANC's NEC was left paralysed as a result of the mistakes done by the former president. â€œYou can characterise that period as a season of madness in the organisation in the sense that there was a paralysis in the NEC occasioned by a faction that was led by the former president," lamented Ramatlhodi.
