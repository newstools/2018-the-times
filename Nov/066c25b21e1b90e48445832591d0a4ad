Nomsa Buthelezi may have received an outpouring of love and support since coming out of the closet but she says she is not yet ready to spill the tea on any wedding plans. The Our Perfect WeddingÂ recently showed off her partner, Zandile Shezi to the world and told TshisaLIVE that she couldn't be happier with life at the moment. "Everything is just going so well. We are happy and I am in a great space. She (Zandile) is such a rock and blessing in my life." But that doesn't mean the trolls haven't come for Nomsa and Zandile. It is just that Nomsa is not giving them any attention. "I don't listen to negativity or things that aren't important. I focus on the positives and love. We have been given so much love and support and we are so grateful for it." And while Nomsa is glowing and loving every moment of her relationship she isn't ready to spill the beans on whether plans for her own perfect wedding are on the cards. "I don't know. We will have to see. I will let everyone know," she said with a laugh, when asked if she thought marriage was on the cards in the future. She explained that it took a while for her to open up to the idea of letting fans into her private space and was still navigating just how open to be. "I like to protect things that are most important to me. I am not hiding them. I am cherishing them," she explained.
