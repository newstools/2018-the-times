Former public enterprises minister Barbara Hoganâ€™s testimony to the state capture inquiry has been adjourned to Wednesday because of power failures. Hogan was expected to give evidence relating to the South African Forestry Companies Limited (Safcol) when the commission reconvened after lunch on Tuesday afternoon. However, due to power outages in the Parktown area where the commission sits, her testimony could not continue. After an hour of interruptions, deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo asked Hogan to return on Wednesday. This will be the third consecutive day the former minister provides testimony. Earlier on Tuesday, Hogan testified that Jacob Zuma allegedly instructed her to halt the process to replace former Eskom boss Jacob Maroga.
