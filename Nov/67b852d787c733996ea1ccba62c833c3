Earlier this week kwaito group TKZee celebrated two decades since the release of their Halloween album. The group which was made up of Zwai Bala, Kabelo Mabalane and Tokollo Tshabalala gave Mzansi hits including Dlala Mapantsula and Mambotji. To celebrate the special occasion Zwai shared a clip from one of their hits. "Today 20 years ago, TKZee released this classic album. We are deeply humbled to have been an integral part of Africa’s cultural evolution. Happy days are here again. Hola 7 for life!” Kabelo's little girl Zoe did the cutest performance of Shibobo.
