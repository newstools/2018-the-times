Mpumalanga police are seeking information that could lead to the arrest of those responsible for the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl this week. According to police, Mihle Zingamo accompanied her sister to a salon on Wednesday, but left to go home because she was hungry. She never arrived. The girl’s father reported her missing at the local police station, after which a search ensued. Her body, with her hands and feet bound, was found dumped on the street at Extension 17 in Embalenhle, police said. “This is not the first incident wherein a child is raped and killed at Embalenhle. On Monday, May 7 2018, 11-year-old Lerato Nkutha was sent to a nearby shop and her mother became worried when she took too long. She went looking for her, with no success, and she then reported the matter to the police, who opened a missing person’s inquiry,” police said. “A search, which consisted of detectives, K9 Unit, as well as police divers, was instituted immediately and it continued until late on Tuesday, May 8 2018, but with no success. “On May 9 2018... police were summoned to a certain house, where a body of a minor was spotted. A short probe by police revealed that the lifeless body was that of missing Lerato,” the police said. They are asking anyone with information that could assist in the investigation and arrest of the suspects in both incidents to contact Detective Captain Sakhile Simon Mlotshwa at 082-970-5774.
