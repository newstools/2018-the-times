Following the death of South African hip hop icon Jabulani "HHP" Tsambo the SA Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG) said it is receiving an influx of calls from people who feel "helpless‚ hopeless and desperate" and in need of help for depression and suicide. "This week‚ we had so many great number of additional suicide callers‚ concerned family members and even work colleagues‚ calling in to ask for help‚ information and emergency intervention‚" the mental health support and advocacy group revealed on Friday. "Our volunteer counsellors have been fielding hundreds of calls per day‚ while more people have been reaching out via emails‚ SMSes and social media.” The hip-hop star died at his home on October 24. He had previously spoken about suffering from depression. His death has now been overshadowed with an urgent court application brought by his wife‚ Lerato Sengadi‚ to stop his funeral from going ahead. Sengadi approached the court after she was excluded by HHP’s father from all the funeral arrangements and she was not allowed to see his body. On Friday afternoon‚ the South Gauteng High Court denied Sengadi's application to halt the funeral. The court did‚ however‚ rule that she is HHP’s customary wife. The SA Depression and Anxiety Group‚ which is not funded by government‚ has urged South Africans to donate funds to the organisation so that they can provide assistance to the growing number of people around the country who may need help.
