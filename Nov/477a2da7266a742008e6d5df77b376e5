As the search for the new Head of the National Prosecuting Authority enters its third phase, it appears the process may be overshadowed by allegations of the existence of a tape showing current acting national director, Silas Ramaite, in a compromising position. Citing sources inside the NPA, the City Press reported on claims of a video depicting Ramaite in a sexual act with a member of the security staff at the NPA offices. Ramaite was appointed to act as a replacement for Shaun Abrahams in August after the Constitutional Court found that the appointment of Abrahams as NPA national director was invalid. The court ruled that Abrahams had benefitted from former President Jacob Zuma's "abuse of power". President Cyril Ramaphosa then named a selection advisory panel to assist him in finding a suitable and permanent candidate for the position. The panel met last month to begin the first phase of the search. That entailed inviting applications and nominations for "fit and proper" South Africans who possess the necessary legal qualifications. The closing date for the submissions was November 2, which brought an end to the second phase of the process. On Monday, the panel begins the work of considering the applications and nominations through a shortlisting and interview process that will continue until November 16. But with a sex tape scandal allegedly brewing around the acting director, the selection advisory panel's work might be overshadowed. NPA spokesperson, Luvuyo Mfaku, said that at this point, the existence of a sex video showing Ramaite is just an "allegation by unnamed sources which infringes his privacy and dignity."
