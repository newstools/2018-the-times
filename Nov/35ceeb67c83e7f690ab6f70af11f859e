DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach has given a thumbs up to the candidates shortlisted for the position of SA’s top prosecutor, with Shamila Batohi, Rodney de Kock and Siyabulela Mapoma her favourites. Breytenbach, a prosecutor by profession, described the position of national director of public prosecutions (NDPP) as a dream job but she had to withdraw from the race because the prosecuting authority did not only have to be politically independent but also had to be seen as immune to political influence. "I’ve propagated the view in the past and the DA's position is that the NDPP should be someone who is fiercely independent and would prosecute without fear, favour or prejudice, and who will right the wrongs in the NPA and do away with the toxic politicisation that has taken place there," she said at a press conference in parliament. "While I have no doubt that I can do it and that’s the reason I accepted the nomination, having given the matter a lot of thought I can’t escape the perception that I am a politician and I will bring that perception to that role if I am appointed. "I don’t think that is in the best interest of the NPA. This isn't about individuals, it's about fixing a really vital state institution," said Breytenbach.
