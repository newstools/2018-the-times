The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) is “appalled” that the Johannesburg Zoo appears to have plans to acquire a new elephant after the death of Kinkel. An animal behaviourist was called in to help the zoo's sole remaining elephant, Lammie, as she mourned the death of her friend Kinkel‚ who died at the zoo in September. NSPCA wildlife trade and trafficking expert Karen Trendler said on Wednesday that the City of Johannesburg had allegedly approved the purchase. Trendler said: “The captive environment for elephants at the Johannesburg Zoo is detrimental to any elephant’s well-being.” But City Parks and Johannesburg Zoo spokesperson Jenny Moodley said they were assessing Lammie and had not yet decided if she would get a companion. Moodley said if the zoo decided to acquire a new elephant, they would have to follow the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (Woza) code of ethics. “It clearly states that we will need to acquire an elephant from another zoo or an elephant that was injured or born in captivity, because you can’t take an elephant from the wild and place them in a zoo.” Johannesburg Zoo would have to go on a waiting list, in accordance with the Woza guidelines. “To get on a waiting list can be a few years," said Moodley. Trendler said the zoo would only be able to bring in local captive elephants and not from an overseas zoo. “It means pulling an elephant away from a bonded group. There are very few captive elephants in South Africa.” Trendler said if a younger elephant was brought to the zoo and Lammie died, the cycle of captivity would continue. “Then you are left with another single elephant.” Trendler said the NSPCA moving Lammie to a sanctuary would benefit her welfare. Animal rights organisation Ban Animal Trading said the zoo would “engage on a low level with stakeholders, make the noises the stakeholders want to hear, while they concoct their little cruel plans behind the scenes to bring in another elephant".
