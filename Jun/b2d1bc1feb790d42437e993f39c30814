Suited hitmaker Shekinah won big at the South African Music Awards, which took place at Sun City on Saturday night. Shekinah took home three gongs in the top five categories, Best Album of the Year, Best Female Artist of the Year and Best Newcomer of the Year. "(Shekinah's album) Rose Gold is for women empowerment. We are killing it as women, let's continue killing it as women of SA," said Shekinah during her acceptance speech. The timeless Mafikizolo also walked away with the Best Afro Pop Award, Best Engineered Album and Best Duo or Group of the Year over the past two nights. It was also a big weekend for gospel group Joyous Celebration, who scooped four gongs, which included awards from the non-broadcast ceremony on Friday night. Joyous Celebration won the Best Selling Album of the Year, Best Selling DVD of the Year, Best Selling Digital Artist of the Year and the Capasso Best Selling Digital Download Composer Award. The coveted Record of the Year Award went to Distruction Boyz for Omunye. "First of all we like to thank God, our parents. It has been a tough journey for us. Gqom is the future, thank you to everyone who voted for us," they said during their acceptance speech. The chilly breeze at Sun City didn't stop music stars from going all out for the glamorous awards ceremony with Pearl Modiadie, Ayanda Ncwane, and Nandi Madida stealing the red carpet spotlight. All eyes were on Lady Zamar whose outfit at the Miss SA pageant last week saw her become a topic of discussion on social media for all the wrong reasons. On Saturday night Lady Zamar dazzled in a mustard and black two-piece outfit, which was inspired by Beauty and the Beast. Lady Zamar also won the Best Dance Album of the Year for King Zamar. Other big winners of the night included Busiswa with Best Kwaito Album, Shane Eagle bagged the coveted Best Hip-Hop Album and Prince Kaybee took Best Male Artist of the year.
