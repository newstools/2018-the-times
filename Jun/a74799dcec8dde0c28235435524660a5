Police shot and killed two men thought to be linked to a botched hijacking that claimed the life of Kelly Chetty in Avoca in Durban on Thursday night. Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker confirmed that detectives had traced the suspected carjackers to the notorious KwaMashu hostel. In a shootout just before dawn‚ two men were shot and killed. A third is believed to have had a hand in Chetty’s death but remains at large. Marshall Security spokesman Kyle van Reenen said medics had rushed to the scene and found a bloodied Chetty still in his car. It was thought that he had stopped to buy fruit from a roadside shop when he was attacked and shot in the chest. “Reports indicate that the man was travelling with his daughter and son in the family vehicle when suspects attempted to hijack another motorist before setting their sights on the victim's Volkswagen‚” Van Reenen said. “An armed suspect fired a shot from the front passenger side of the vehicle‚ striking the victim. The children‚ although severely traumatised‚ were not harmed in the incident.”
