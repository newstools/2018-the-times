Schoolchildren‚ clad in their uniforms‚ run towards a truck and‚ just before it smashes into them‚ dive out of the the way. A video capturing this daring scene of school pupils dicing with death along the N1 in De Doorns‚ Western Cape‚ has gone viral. In the footage‚ the uniform-clad pupils are seen first running towards the truck‚ before moving out of its way just split seconds before it can strike. While one pupil is heard shrieking in fear‚ the person taking the video - who is believed to be a minor - is heard laughing in the background. "There are two coming‚" he says to two boys who are about to go in for their adrenalin rush. The one pupil runs into the road in front of the truck and stops briefly‚ pretending to be tying his shoelaces just a few metres from the approaching truck. He then darts out of the truck’s way seconds before it reaches him. One of the truckers hoots as he barely misses the child. The SA Long Distance Truckers group said the incident happened last month. One person took to the trucker's Facebook page to share her frustration of what she sees on the road. "This happens in De Doorns all the time. Not just on the N1. And even way smaller children do the same‚" she said. "It's a big game to them. Some also like throwing stuff at passing vehicles‚ including rocks. But it's always the poor drivers fault when something bad happens and then the mother wants to cry on TV‚ but 95% of the time she doesn't even know where her child is. And the traffic cops are never where they are supposed to be!" The long distance truckers group said it had since handed the video to provincial police for investigation.
