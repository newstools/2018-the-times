There’s something special about the drive-in, but it’s something that’s been lost in Joburg over the past few years as the city’s drive-in complexes have closed down. That is until the team at Magnum Events reignited the concept by introducing special monthly drive-in evenings. “I first tested the event about three years ago, and people really loved it,” says Drive-In director Leone Amon. “We held it at Riversands Farm and we had people who drove an hour just to get there. There were lots of people who had never experienced the drive-in before. We met many people and listened to their feedback, and we took it from there. It was especially great to see how the kids loved it, and they encouraged their parents to bring them back.” With so many guests being kids, the Drive-In team has kept the event child-friendly. “We put a poll up on the Facebook events page where we ask people to vote for what film they’d like to see. There are always two films shown, with the first being child-friendly.” One of the highlights for guests at the Drive-In is the incredible food sold from stalls on site. You can enjoy some great food while you watch the classics – think nachos, pancakes, co­ffee, craft beer and, of course, popcorn. But unlike many other drive-in experiences, guests can bring in their own food. “We don’t force customers to purchase food or drinks from the event, so people can pack their own picnics, letting them decide what kind of food and evening they’d like to have,” says Leone. With new dates, films, locations and excuses to have a good time every month, it’s the perfect way to spend your next date night, friends’ night, family night – any night out, really!
