A mineworker was killed during a rockfall at Sibanye Gold's Carletonville mine on Friday morning. "There was fall of ground at the end of the shaft. Three employees were affected‚" said spokesman James Wellsted. One of the three was discharged from hospital while a second mineworker was in a stable condition in hospital‚ Wellsted said. Wellsted said the rockfall was not a result of seismic activity‚ but simply a gravity fall. "It could be a due to a number of reasons. They may have been cleaning or putting on support there because that is what normally what happens at the end of a shift‚" Wellsted said. Operations at the mine were continuing on Friday.
