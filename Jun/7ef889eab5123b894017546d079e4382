Marine movements at the port of Richards Bay resumed on Tuesday after four-metre swells and wind gusts of over 55km/h forced it to suspend vessels coming in for almost 40 hours. Transnet National Ports Authority said in a statement that adverse weather conditions had led to the suspension of marine movements. The suspension remained in effect for 39 hours‚ from Sunday evening to Tuesday morning. Nompumelelo Mkhize‚ acting harbour master at the port of Richards Bay‚ said only two vessels had been affected by the suspension and had already entered port. On Monday Transnet Port Terminals’ Durban Container Terminal's waterside operations "were also on standby for over seven hours due to wind speeds recorded between 80 and 100km/h”. “The safety of our people‚ equipment and our customers’ cargo is always seen as a priority so due to adverse weather conditions our waterside operations were temporarily affected. However‚ our landside and rail operations continued as normal throughout this period as they did not face the same safety challenges‚” Transnet added.
