Kim Kardashian West received the first-ever Influencer Award at the 2018 CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) Fashion Awards in New York last night. "I'm kind of shocked I'm winning a fashion award when I'm naked most of the time," Kardashian West joked in her acceptance speech. She went on to say that when she once told a publicist that her dream was to be on the cover of a fashion magazine, the publicist told her to get some realistic goals because that would never happen. "And so of course I sent her my Vogue cover when it came out, an autographed copy," the reality TV star quipped. "It's really a trip to me that now I’m up here getting an award for fashion when it’s something that I’ve always loved, so thank you so much for this. It means a lot," she added. Designer Tommy Hilfiger, a CDFA board member, explained why the council had chosen to honour Kardashian West in a statement on the CDFA website: "Kim is the most important and powerful influencer in the world. Her reach extends far beyond her own brands. Every time she wears, posts or talks about a fashion brand, there is an immediate and significant increase in both awareness and sales." Kardashian West dominates social media with 111 million followers on Instagram, 30 million on Facebook and 59.9 million on Twitter. A regular in fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and Cosmopolitan, Kardashian West also has a vested interest in the fashion and beauty industries. Her brands include the KKW Beauty and KKW Fragrance companies as well as the children's clothing line Kids Supply and the emoji series Kimoji. The CFDA Awards are designed to celebrate the best of the US fashion industry. This year's other big-name winners include model Naomi Campbell, who received Fashion Icon Award, and designer Diane von Furstenberg, who received the Swarovski Award for Positive Change. • Additional reporting by staff reporter.
