A few minutes after the South African Music Awards (Samas) got underway on Saturday night, Skolopad had to be carried out on a stretcher by paramedics after she collapsed. According to Sunday World the musician fainted just before songstress Shekinah took to the stage to perform at the swanky awards ceremony. "She fainted, she is ok, it was just some weird exhaustion. But she is awake and still on my stretcher," a paramedic told the paper. Apparently Skolopad was taken to hospital but a source told the paper that she insisted that she was fine and wanted to be taken back to her hotel room to rest. Dressed in a sheer black dress, Skolopad arrived on the red carpet late. She told TshisaLIVE that she got lost and was therefore late for the red carpet action.
