Just when we thought this week couldn't get any more stressful, AKA dropped a track that has more files than a nail bar in Sandton. The track is called Beyonce but it isn't about Queen Bey in America. The Twitter streets still think it is about our own Queen B, Bonang. A viral video released on Twitter this week saw AKA drop some bars from the song. "Waited two years just to see you with your weave off... What that say about your character, you was f**king me while I was paying damages," Bonang trended after that and has been the topic of conversation ever since. The streets got messier when the full track dropped on Friday and the spice was pouring like masala in a curry pot. The track opened with lines like: "How you gonna be my fiance living like Rihanna, thinking you Beyonce" and "When I left my baby mama I thought you will be my soulmate – you was a bomb bae". His mentions of their infamous Mozambique trip and baby mama drama had people convinced it was Bonang he was talking about, and when he said he couldn't keep up with her "DMs and airbrush" folks were tripped up like... Just to show everyone he's in control, the rapper took to his Twitter throne to tell the world not to thank him for the music but thank God for  giving us AKA. The Twitter paramedics had to be called for all the chaos on the timelines, with people sharing the massacre in memes and jokes. Others were out there trying to decipher the lyrics like it's CSI: Mzansi. Bonang and AKA previously pulled a stunt on fans, claiming to have broken up but later revealed it was a prank. TshisaLIVE has made attempts to get hold of both. Team Bonang has said they are not ready to comment as yet and attempts to get hold of AKA and his team have been unsuccessful.
