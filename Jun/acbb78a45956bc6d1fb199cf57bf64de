Rita Ora has released the revised music video for her single Girls featuring Cardi B, Charli XCX and Bebe Rexha. Girls was met with controversy upon its May 11 release, accused of doing more harm than good for the LGBTQ+ community. The track was called out by queer music figures as perpetuating stereotypes: it was seen to miss the mark and perpetuate the male gaze. Ora initially released a statement defending the track saying she was inspired by Katy Perry's I Kissed a Girl. She also tweeted an apology explaining that the song was based on her own life experiences.
