It's been a minute since Thembi Seete gave birth to her first child, but she's out here showing us flames. While, we're struggling to beat the winter blues and all the comfort eating that comes with that, Thembi is out here slaying. Thembi stepped out to a Ponds event last weekend, and she looked every bit the classy mama. Dressed in a black, figure-hugging polka dot dress, paired with red heels, Thembi oozed class and sophistication. And, can we just talk about that smoking-hot figure? Thembi has kept her pregnancy away from the public eye, and has maintained that in her culture its a private matter. However, as she celebrated her first Mother's Day earlier this month, Thembi gushed over her baby. "When anything comes at the right time, God ensures we are ready and PRESENT.Â I had to be present enough to live in every moment with you. From carrying you for 9 months to giving birth and watching you grow into your own person & learning who God has created you to be on a daily basis."
