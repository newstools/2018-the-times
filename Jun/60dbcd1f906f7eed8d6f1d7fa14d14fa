What do you do if a pair of rhino charge your car? Screech in terror seems to be the answer. A video has resurfaced on social media that catches the moment two rhinos start charging towards a car in a safari park. It's not clear when or where the video was shot, but in the clip the terrified passengers laugh in relief as the rhinos stop short of hitting the vehicle and veer around it.
