Who said rappers have to wear suits in order to make a magazine cover? Well, Kwesta just proved this perception wrong. The Spirit hitmaker is on the cover of GQ magazine, and served major hip-hop flavour on the cover. Dressed in printed pants, a white t-shirt and a smart casual coat - Kwesta looked dope. And, definitely pushed boundaries as only Kwesta can!
