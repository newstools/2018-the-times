It looks like nobody is here for L-tido's self-imposed peace maker gig. Both the heads of the Megacy and the Tsibipians aren't interested in burying the hatchet and they've both come out to let L-tido know. The rivalry between Cassper Nyovest and AKA has been ongoing for years butÂ  L-Tido took a shot at trying to get the two to reach a real truce through a bet on Monday. It obviously failed before we could even foster some hope because Cassper quickly shut it down. We also thought that after Cassper's blatant "no," L-tido would let the things go but on Tuesday L-tido tried again... This time AKA's manager also took to Twitter to ask 16 V to stop with the "make peace" requests. Prince told L-tido they had more than enough friends in the industry and he must just let them be and also allow Cass to focus on his work too. Look... Cassper and the Tsibipians said no. AKA (by extension) and the Megacy said no. So... basically what everyone said to L-tido is: Thanks but no thanks and anyway... (see Gif below)
