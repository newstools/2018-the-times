Scooping the Miss SA crown has been nothing short of a dream come true for Tamaryn Green and she knows she couldn't have done it without her strong support system. Taking to Instagram a few days after being crowned Miss SA, Tamaryn gushed over the role her parents have played in making sure her dream became a reality. She also said that winning the title still feel unbelievable to her. "It still feels quite surreal and overwhelming but my heart is so happy. This post goes to my parents for all the love and support they've showed me. For all the opportunities they provided me. I would not be where I am today without them. I love you mom and dad." She also dedicated the next year to making a difference in Mzansi. "South Africa I dedicate the next 365 days in service of you. For my people, with my people, together. Ps. Thank you to each and every person who commented, who wrote, who supported. I promise to get back to you as soon as possible."
