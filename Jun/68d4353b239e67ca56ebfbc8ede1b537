Emanuel Tshabalala couldn't hold back the tears as the court heard the details of how he shot and killed his son outside a Johannesburg school on Tuesday. "This is my first accident and a painful one‚" he tearfully told the court. The court, taking into account the fact that he handed himself over and had cooperated fully with the police, released him on a warning. Magistrate Maggie van der Merwe said: “I can only describe this incident as a tragedy.”
