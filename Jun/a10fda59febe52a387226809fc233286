All roads led to Sun City on Saturday night for the annual South African Music Awards (Samas). Mzansi's A-listers pulled out all the stops on the red carpet, and served major heat. Pearl Modiadie oozed sophistication and class in a bedazzled dress, while LootLove and Khanya Mkangisa served sauce in sheer gowns. Ayanda Ncwane looked nothing short of glamorous in a red dress. Riky Rick's colourful ensemble was a little odd and got tongues wagging on social media from the moment he walked the red carpet. The hosts for the swanky awards are Somizi Mhlongo, Dineo Ranaka and Mpho Popps. As this is the last time Somizi will be hosting the awards ceremony after three years in a row, the flamboyant personality plans to dazzle as usual. "I’m pulling all stops. I’m giving my all. I’m not holding back. I’m talking lights camera action. Hair changes. Make up art. No less than 7 outfit changes," he said before the show. Nominees who will be competing to take home a Sama tonight includes Shekinah, Mi Casa, Mafikizolo, Lady Zamar, Distruction Boyz, and Kwesta. You can catch the show live on SABC 1 at 8pm or follow @TshisaLIVE for live updates from Sun City.
