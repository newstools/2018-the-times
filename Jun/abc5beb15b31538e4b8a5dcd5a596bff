The inquiry into the South African Revenue Service kicked off on Tuesday. Suspended SARS boss Tom Moyane is accused of costing SARS, and South Africa, at least R142-billion. The Nugent Inquiry has looked into claims of mismanagement, alleged criminality and political interference at SARS. Among the claims made at the hearing is that there was  a climate of fear, bullying and intimidation at SARS. Moyane’s lawyer Eric Mabuza, however, has labelled the inquiry a witch hunt.
