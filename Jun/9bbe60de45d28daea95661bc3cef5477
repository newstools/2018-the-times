No matter how much "hate" is thrown at Cassper Nyovest, the rapper always manages to bounce back harder and he gives credit to his loyal Tsibipians aka his fans. Cassper, who was announced as one of two SA artists nominated at the BET awards, has been hard at work campaigning for votes to bag the award. He replied to a tweet by one of his followers who observed that Cassper wasn't receiving support from industry mates. The rapper took to Twitter to explain that he's learnt that there's so much "hate and envy" that has led to people only hyping a person's demise. He said that is why he appreciated his fans. While on his way to catch a flight to London, Cassper also caught some feels when he remembered how far he'd come despite naysayers who crushed his dreams. The rapper remembered the time he overheard someone say how there would never be another Maftown-born rapper, other than Khuli Chana, who would break boundaries. The rapper will also be reppin' SA at the One Africa Music Festival in London. How cool?
