It’s curious how beer has remained relatively unexplored in cooking while wine, synonymous with food, is pivotal in so many dishes. Yet, the handful of ingredients — barley, hops, water and yeast — make for a good food match. The hops add an interesting bitterness with a hint of acidity, the malt a subtle sweetness, and the yeast a lightness and crispness. Some of the better-known beer/food combinations include adding Guinness to a steak pie, or beer to the batter for fried fish. Beer can also be used in place of wine to deglaze a pan and can even be added to gravies or marinades. As with wine, don’t use a beer for cooking that you would not choose to drink. Light beers work with lighter foods and heavy beers suit dishes like stews and casseroles. Select a sweeter beer for desserts and salty dishes. Try these easy recipes for delicious dishes that hero beer:
