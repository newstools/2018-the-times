This follows the decision to place the Gauteng-based municipality under administration for six months.

Emfuleni was put under administration because of its inability to provide adequate service delivery and due to allegations of maladministration. Makhura said the decision was taken ensure that service delivery took place‚ and to “ensure the financial viability through a financial recovery plan”. During the briefing‚ the premier also slammed claims that the move to place the Emfuleni municipality under administration was linked to the struggle for control of the ANC in Gauteng. Although Makhura indicated that the municipality was receiving threats from Eskom and Rand water to shut down services‚ he vowed to work hand in hand with Khawe to bring about change to the municipality.
