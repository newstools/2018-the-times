A Johannesburg Metro Police officer found herself having to go above and beyond her call of duty last week when she was forced to swap her role as law enforcement officer for that of midwife. JMPD Inspector Frieda Ramafemo was on her way home at the end of her shift on Tuesday evening when she was waved down by an Uber driver near the Riviera Road turnoff on the busy M1 highway. The driver explained that his pregnant passenger was experiencing contractions and that it appeared she would have to give birth inside the vehicle. Inspector Ramafemo immediately called for an EMS ambulance to come to the scene and then assisted the mother in labour. “The expecting mother was experiencing intense pain and her contractions seemed very close apart. Showing signs of labour‚ I had to keep her calm and prepare for the emergency birth‚” said Ramafemo. However‚ the mother gave birth to a healthy baby boy before the ambulance arrived with Ramafemo’s assistance. When the paramedics arrived‚ they found both mother and child to be healthy and took them to the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. So touched was the mother by Ramafemo's assistance that she asked her to bless her child with a second name. Overwhelmed by the gesture‚ Ramafemo named the baby “Zipho”‚ which means “gift”. Johannesburg Public Safety MMC Michael Sun commended Ramafemo’s bravery. “This is a movie moment in reality. We are so proud of Inspector Ramafemo for her bravery and humanity in going above the call of her duty. We wish the mother and baby Zipho good health and will definitely be visiting them soon.” Both the mother and baby Zipho have been discharged from hospital and are recuperating at home.
