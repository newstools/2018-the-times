The annual South African Music Awards (Samas) was like the candy shop of entertainment, so many flavours and so many different sweets to cater for different people, we had our favourite moments and at the very top, was Mpho Popps' hosting skills. What a host! In addition to the usual artist friendly rivalry and all the other nice things that sets Twitter on fire like outfits... (cc. Riky Rick), Mpho Popps just did the damn thing and was a definite highlight of the night. While there are probably a couple of favourable moments that the Samas gifted us with, these were the top five. Mpho Popps bowled us over with his comedy and on stage energy to be honest he could have easily handled the whole event alone if need be.  Somizi and Dineo were okay, but Mpho really capitalised on his shine. #HireMphoPopps All (and we mean all...there were a lot) the reminders of the all important "Thuma Mina" message, courtesy of President Cyril Ramaphosa's presence at the Samas. Side note: We hope he was listening to all the #bringbacktheland hints. Not to say all the other amazing artists who went home with awards, didn't get fans excited but at the mere mention of Shekhinah's name, the whole room erupted. So every time she was on stage or her song played the people were happy. When she kept bagging those awards... the people were over the moon. (the people is us and others like us). She did good! Riky Rick's "open minded" outfit that shut down the red carpet Uhm there's really not much to say here. You either get it or you don't. The guy wanted to fade or something like that... Particularly that last jol... shout out to the people who make an event a party! Busiswa aka the Midnight Starring, we see you girl! Even you Omunye boys, you unleash the Zodwa Wabantu vosho in us and we appreciate y'all.
