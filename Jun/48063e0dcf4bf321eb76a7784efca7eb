There was some scepticism on Friday as President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a panel to review the State Security Agency‚ along with a new(ish) security adviser. But a closer look at the panel reveals that Ramaphosa has chosen a cast of highly regarded experts to probe the reported mess at the spy agency. The president’s new security adviser is former minister and struggle veteran Charles Nqakula. The 10 panel members are equally stellar. They are: Currently‚ he serves as research professor at the Centre for the Advancement of Scholarship at the University of Pretoria. The prof was also one of the veterans who signed a petition seeking change under former president Jacob Zuma. The group eventually called for Zuma to step down. Other luminaries include former police chief Andre Pruis‚ former DG of the SSA Silumko Sokupa‚ financial sector expert Murray Michell‚ lawyer Basetsana Molebatsi‚ Rhodes academic Siphokazi Magadla‚ who spoke in support of the Rhodes Must Fall kids‚ and Prof Jane Duncan from the University of Johannesburg‚ who two years ago presented a lecture that questioned whether South Africa was becoming a repressive state. Below are some of the reactions elicited by the announcement on Twitter.
