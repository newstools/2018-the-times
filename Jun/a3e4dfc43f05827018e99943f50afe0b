Protest action on the N2’s Umgeni flyover in Durban saw two municipal trucks torched on Wednesday afternoon. It is understood that a mob of demonstrators had blocked the on-ramp from the M19 onto the N2’s southbound carriage way‚ blocking the path of a Durban Solid Waste truck carrying plant refuse. The group then stoned the vehicle‚ which then collided with another car in the driver’s attempt to flee. The protesters then set fire to the truck. An elderly woman‚ the driver of the car‚ was seriously injured and was treated at the scene by paramedics. It is understood that before police arrived at the scene‚ the woman was robbed by the group. Riot police were quickly deployed to the scene‚ allowing eThekwini Metro firefighters to extinguish the blaze. The burning of the truck followed another incident on Electron Road in the Springfield precinct‚ after the group torched another truck. Traffic headed out of the city was adversely affected. This is a developing story.
