Jessica Lyman was on a drive through the Kruger National Park when she came across a pair of buffalo that had locked horns - and got stuck. Eventually another member of their herd came along to help them out of their embarrassing predicament, unlocking them with a little shove. The video was posted to YouTube by the Kruger National Park.
