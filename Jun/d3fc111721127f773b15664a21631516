Fans may have put Skeem Saam's Wallet on suicide watch but the well-travelled hospital porter is only concerned about one thing: his pigs. We have come to love Wallet over the last few weeks, especially for his poems that are pure fire, so imagine the internet's surprise when this week he suggested that the most precious thing in his world was his pigs. After all the bad luck he's been going through lately, which include leaving his job of an awards show he isn't even part of, the streets were hoping his luck would change. But as he seemed to spiral into depression and hopelessness, he only asked that someone help him look after his pigs. He tried to confront his former boss with his pension forms to get some coins but was stopped by security and was told he should wait for his money like everyone else because he was "not special". The social media streets were filled with tears for poor Wallet and pledges to help him. Shame. The situation was so bad that even ugogo Koko offered to help, taking out some cash from her bra to help him.
