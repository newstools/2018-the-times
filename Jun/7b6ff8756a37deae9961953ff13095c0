Hot on the heels of last year's naked pop-up restaurant craze, a luxury travel brand has released a quirky new carry-on suitcase that is entirely transparent. The limited-edition case is the result of a collaboration between German luggage maker Rimowa and the Italian streetwear label Off-White. It may seem an odd choice in which to stow some underwear and toiletries, but its makers describe it as a "brazen, yet playful response to today's obsessive talk of the privacy culture of surveillance and anonymity." Called the Rimowa x Off-White Cabin Multiwheel, the case, made of polycarbonate with a see-through trunk and black-accented handle and wheels, costs â‚¬850 (R13,400). For the sake of aestheticism, it has no interior lining, but does come with black, removable bags for more modest packing - so you can still keep your undies out of view. Its designer, Virgil Abloh, says it came out of "an experimentation where we studied travelling and one's emotional connection to one's personal belongings". It was set to roll down the runway this week at Off-White's show in Paris and can be ordered from tomorrow at rimowa.com.
