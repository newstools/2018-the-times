The eviction was carried out until 1am in the morning on Saturday. A number of people were wounded during the attack‚" said Abahlali in a statement. "This morning Abahlali baseMjondolo went to court in defence of our members. We defeated the eThekwini Municipality in court. "The movement has obtained a spoliation order to reinstate our members who have been illegally evicted by the municipality. The court ordered that those who were illegally evicted in Barcelona 2 must be reinstated‚ and that the municipality does not carry out any further evictions in the area‚" the statement read.
