The lawyer who admitted to dumping his family’s dead labrador on the side of a road in Johannesburg has apologised to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). Adam Anderson wrote in his letter of apology that he and his wife had adopted Mbali 13 years ago‚ when she was a year old‚ from the Sandton Marlboro SPCA. Mbali died at their home on Sunday night. “I have acknowledged that I was completely wrong in disposing of the body of Mbali as I did. I have expressed‚ and I continue to express‚ my sincere regret and remorse for my unacceptable conduct.” The SPCA sent the letter out on its mailing list on Friday evening. “I am aware that my apology will not change the facts. However‚ I hope that my future conduct and actions will show how truly sorry I am. I would also like to apologise to everyone who has been affected by my actions.” Anderson has offered to help the SPCA by doing community service and “initiatives promoting the values and rights that the SPCA strives to uphold”. The lawyer admitted on Thursday that he dumped Mbali on the side of the road in Kensington. He was caught on CCTV footage opening the boot of his Mercedes Benz and glancing around before dumping the carcass on a quiet street. Anderson could not immediately meet the SPCA‚ because he is in the Northern Cape for a funeral‚ but he and his wife met an official on Friday. The Sandton SPCA said on Thursday it was in the process of laying criminal charges for illegal dumping‚ in terms of the City of Johannesburg’s by-laws. Sandton SPCA spokesperson Jaco Pieterse said on Friday: “At this stage‚ the SPCA cannot prove any form of animal abuse or contraventions of the Animals Protection Act. The act of illegal dumping‚ however‚ stands.” Anderson’s law firm has distanced itself from the incident.
