Power to the Johannesburg CBD and surrounding areas which have been without electricity for the past three days has been restored.

The ones that could not be repaired were replaced. “Repair and replacement work was completed this morning at 1.30am by which time power was restored to all the aforesaid areas‚” Masolo said. On Thursday night City Power restored electricity to Newtown‚ Village Main‚ Jeppe and parts of the city centre.Masolo said the cause of the tunnel fire was currently being investigated. “City Power would like to thank all the customers for showing patience and apologises for inconvenience caused. “As it is the winter season‚ the power network is constrained as a result City Power appeals to all its customers to use electricity sparingly‚” he added.
