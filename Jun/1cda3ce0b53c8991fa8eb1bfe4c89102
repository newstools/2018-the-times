She just got a McLaren worth over R3-million and now Amanda du-Pont is carrying on with those best life things and is spending her birthday in the Maldives. Levels! She is celebrating the big 30 and obvs deserved a bit of indulgence. Private helicopters to luxury resort life, Amanda is doing that damn thing. "What a dream! God knew I needed this year to be a turn around...Calling it the turn around 30! This year my life has been a turn around. He has elevated me to spaces and levels only His grace could do. And in turn increased my faith. Iâ€™m just so grateful for the gift of life."
