Through the Eyes of an African Chef by Nompumelelo Mqwebu has been named the world's best self-published cookbook at the prestigious Gourmand World Cookbook Awards. Known at the "Oscars" of the cookbook world, this year's award ceremony was held in Yantai, China, with books from 205 countries vying for prizes. Mqwebu, from Umlazi in KwaZulu-Natal, is a champion of seasonal, local African produce like baobab and imifino (spinach). Her cookbook features recipes for African classics as well as for traditional dishes which have been given a modern, fine-dining twist. (Try her recipe for samp and beans in bone marrow.) "I am very excited that I have managed to win. I think it is a huge stepping stone for African cuisine and for chefs in South Africa as well,'" said Mqwebu. She explained that the award was a great source of pride, not only for her, but also for the young chefs and women farmers who have taught her about indigenous crops and how to cook traditional dishes. "I'm super excited. [The award] will bring lots of opportunity, and [I hope] that as I grow I take others with me as well," she added.
