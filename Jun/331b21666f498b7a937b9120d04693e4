Hat-trick hero Cristiano Ronaldo’s sensational free-kick two minutes from time earned Portugal a 3-3 draw with Spain in a pulsating World Cup Group B encounter on Friday. Ronaldo had given Portugal a dream start winning and scoring a fourth minute penalty. Diego Costa levelled only for Ronaldo to put the 2016 European champions back in front just before half-time. Costa once again got Spain back level with Nacho scoring his first ever goal giving Spain the lead, only for Ronaldo’s magical 88th minute set piece to earn Portugal a share of the spoils in Sochi.
