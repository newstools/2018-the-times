Remember when AKA and Cassper hugged in a club after Cass filled up Orlando Stadium in 2016? Yeah, fans rejoiced and everyone thought it was the end of the long-standing rivalry between the two rappers. Well, just like government's hope of making e-tolls a success is slowly wearing thin, the hope of Cassper and AKA being friends has also faded away. Cassper, who performed at the One Africa Music Festival in London last week, was speaking to followers on Twitter about unity in the hip-hop industry, when he made it clear that he and AKA would never be in the same WhatsApp group. A tweep reminded Cassper of how AKA wanted to mend fences by performing at FNB Stadium but Cass shut him down. The follower said that the only way there would be unity in the industry was if it started with AKA and Cassper. Cassper made it clear that he was willing to mend fences with anyone else except that "broer" (OUCH!) Cassper said that he was even willing to get into studio with Emtee even after the young rapper disrespected him. "Even that one is possible too. He’s disrespected me and I’ve offended him to but I’m willing to build still. He’s talented & I know he might even take this tweet and disrespect me again and I’ll still be willing to work with him cause I love SA hip-hop and that’s what it needs."
