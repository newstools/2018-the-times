As the 21st edition of the World Cup nears the start, one team that is sure to win, one way or another, is the Fantasy XI. Not only are these impossibly good-looking specimens, but they also know how to handle their balls. Playing in the unconventional 3-4-3 formation, this team will allow for a number of options across the field, providing great viewing pleasure and dynamism. If it were possible to write in tongues, we would. Here's the breakdown of this bunch of winners: These are the poster boys for how to wear a white shirt, a necessary and respectable trait for any self-respecting manager. Not only will this coaching pair set the sidelines on fire, but both experienced managers have proven that they are men who can roll up their sleeves and get the thirst-trap job done. Manu can do a lot with his big, safe hands. He is sure to sweep fans off their feet with his devastating good looks: a real keeper. Here we are looking at solid skills and control from the back: players who will keep things tight and right. Versatile in their positioning, all three have proven exciting in different positions. Large, physically strong and with great technique, this is a threesome we're backing to go all the way to a climactic finish. This is a deep and penetrative midfield that will keep things solid within the belly. Each player shows great initiative and even better thrust going forward. With so much collective talent, they will play the field with great aplomb. These are men who deserve to score over and over again. CR7 is a previous winner of the Ballon d'Ã“r, five-time winner of the Champions League and all-round hunk. Giroud has headed some important goals with his aerial prowess. But the real MVP (most valuable player) here is Guerrero, who beat a cocaine-related 14-month ban to be named captain of Peru, who will be competing for the first time in 36 years. Sit tight boys, we see you and we are keen to get you off the bench.
