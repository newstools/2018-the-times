Don't annoy an elephant - especially one that's having a relaxing dip. Tourists in Botswana discovered this the hard way when an elephant charged - and hit - their boat while they were cruising down the Chobe River. Radio and TV presenter at GROOTfm 90.5 and Die Groot ontbyt Su-An Marais decided to record the scene elephant as the tour boat approached. “What could go wrong? I mean, even a fully grown elephant can't swim that fast in deep water, right?” she told Latest Sightings. Marais' mother-in-law can be heard saying "Hello liefie (lovey)!". Not liking that at all, the beast charged. "Luckily I was already recording, because the charge happened so fast that I wouldn't have been able to get my camera out on time for the action," Su-An said. Fortunately the elephant didn't tip the boat, which quickly moved away from the agitated beast.
