It's been almost a year since actor Dumi Masilela was shot and killed in a botched hijacking and his widow, Simz Ngema, continues to mourn him and pay tribute to him. Simz regularly posts pictures of herself with Dumi and in a recent snap of the couple, Simz again cemented her love for Dumi. "I will love you until my heart canâ€™t love no more, until my forever ends. My memory still loves you and I still get butterflies at the thought of you giving me your forever." Her comments section was immediately filled with messages of love and support.
