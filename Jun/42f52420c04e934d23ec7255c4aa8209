Former city of Tshwane mayor Kgosientso "Sputla" Ramokgopa is being lobbied to challenge Gauteng premier David Makhura for the ANC provincial chairman top post. Makhura was initially expected to take over the position, left vacant after Paul Mashatile was elected treasurer-general at the ANC, but supporters of Lebogang Maile, former ANC Youth League chairman in Gauteng and current MEC, have different ideas. They are unhappy with Makhura and accuse him of abusing state resources to block his political opponents. The unhappiness seems to have been sparked by Makhura's move to refer allegations of “irregularities and maladministration” in the department of agriculture, which is headed by Maile — to the Special Investigating Unit. Maile wants to be deputy chairman, a post which is expected to be contested by former Johannesburg mayor Parks Tau and education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi. Makhura is said to prefer Tau to be his deputy. Ramokgopa, who is ANC chairman in Tshwane, told the Sunday Times that  he had heard about the plan from his comrades but he had not be formally approached to stand. Branches from his region are said to be nominating only Makhura for the position of chairman. Makhura told the Sunday Times he would not be deterred from acting against wrongdoing because of a looming ANC conference.
