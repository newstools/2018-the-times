Rape is rarely a violent crime and should be punishable by 200 hours of community service, feminist Germaine Greer has suggested, as she poured scorn on the idea that victims are left with post-traumatic stress disorder. The Australian writer and public intellectual said the system must be overhauled because few cases that hinge on consent end in a conviction. She joked that the most suitable punishment would be for rapists to have an “R” tattooed on their hand or cheek. Greer was the victim of a rape when she was in her late teens, a violent attack in which she was repeatedly beaten. But she told an audience at the Hay Festival in England: “Most rapes don’t involve any injury whatsoever. We are told it’s one of the most violent crimes in the world – bullshit. Most rape is just lazy, just careless, just insensitive. Every time a man rolls over on his exhausted wife and insists on enjoying his conjugal right, he is raping her. It will never end up in a court of law.”
