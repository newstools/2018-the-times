The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) has ordered the department of public works to draft a report on costs it has incurred during the renovations of ministerial houses. Scopa on Thursday instructed the Director-General of the Department of Public Works‚ Sam Vukela‚ to submit a detailed report on costs incurred by the department as a result of deviations and contract expansions during renovations of ministerial houses. “During a meeting with the department to discuss deviations and expansions in the public sector Scopa chairperson Themba Godi said the report must also include total costs of extras such as braai areas in the ministerial homes‚” the committee said. Vukela was also ordered to investigate the circumstances around the employment of department Chief Financial Officer Cox Mokgoro. “Members of Scopa wanted clarity on the employment of Mr Mokgoro as well as the contracting of his company‚ Honey Cloud Enterprises‚ to the Department of Public Works after a Treasury report raised questions about the process followed.”
