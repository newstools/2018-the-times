Idols SA winner Paxton Fieles said she was confused when she was told by fans that she had apparently plagiarised the song that would be her first Idols single. Paxton hit the headlines in her last weeks on the competition after it was alleged that her song was an exact copy of a K-pop group Rania/BP Rania's hit single Demonstrate. Gallo explained that the song's rights were approved by the composer and their publisher. And even though Paxton was shook by the allegations, she told TshisaLIVE she wasn't scared that it result in her losing the competition. "I had complete faith in my team and in the record company. I naturally phoned them up when it broke but I wasn't concerned because I knew they would handle it. It was a lesson for me because I know that my time in the industry will get harder and I have to deal with stuff like this." "My family have always been super supportive of me and they stood by me. I didn't worry." Remember him?... "He is maybe more famous than me. I call him my uncle because he is a very close family friend. My family couldn't make it to some of the shows in Johannesburg so I gave him my tickets and he was always there. He was always crying. It made me emotional. I knew where he liked to sit and I would look out for him." "I don't know if there is such thing as a curse of the Idols winner because people have gone on to have great careers. I just have to find my niche in the industry. My space where I can belong. It is tough but I am patient with myself and I am taking as much advice as I can get." "I met Amanda in the Idols house and she has been there for me ever since. She has taught me lessons like I need to be true to myself and work hard. I really appreciate having people like her in my corner." "I am really happy with the album and I think it will introduce people to me all over again. I took my time with it and had a lot of fun. I didn't limit myself with it and I think that will come across."
