It looks like Mother's Day came a tad earlier for Enhle-Mbali's mom, who received a luxurious ride on Wednesday. What a fab gift! The gorgeous mom and make-up artist took to her Instagram to share the news that her mkhwenyana (son-in-law) had blessed her with a new ride. She posted a picture of herself perched on the bonnet of the car with a bouquet of flowers and tear-filled eyes. "My mkhwenyana surprised me with a car today I cried my tears out. Mother's Day came early for me ngiyabonga Mashimane." If there was ever any son-in-law Olympics, then Coffee has won everything. The DJ also blessed his mother with a fancy Mercedez last year and his wife was also gifted with a snazzy ride earlier this year. While we're still talking mode of transportation, Coffee also rented an entire private jet for his tour. Talk about levels!
