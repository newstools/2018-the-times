A young child was knocked off her feet by a car during an armed robbery in Randburg, Johannesburg on Saturday. CCTV footage shows a vehicle pulling into a driveway in Blairgowrie, as a woman and her child walk along the street. A few seconds after the vehicle enters the property, a white sedan comes screeching up to the entrance, knocking the child of her feet. The woman, who is carrying a baby on her back, pulls the child up then hurries off as several armed robbers leap out of the sedan and rush into the property. In the next instant, the vehicle inside the property reverses back into the wall, pushing it and the gate over. Unfazed, the criminals yank open the vehicles doors and appear to rummage inside. After a few minutes, they race off in the getaway vehicle. It's unclear if anyone was injured in the attack.
