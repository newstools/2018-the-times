Golf balls‚ beach umbrellas and toy guns are not something you’d usually find at a violent protest. But Parkwood residents in Cape Town took to using whatever was available during running battles with police on Wednesday. The conflict began on Saturday when Parkwood residents erected temporary structures on vacant land next to the M5 highway. The residents were protesting about the lack of housing and the poor living conditions in their area. “I live in a small house with eight adults and 10 children. I can’t live like that anymore‚ we need space and our own house‚” said Nicole Davis while sitting in her tent on Tuesday. Western Cape housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela arrived on Tuesday to calm tensions building in the area. However‚ Madikizela’s promises to look into the matter and his request for the protesters to leave the area fell on deaf ears. “If he wants us off this land‚ he’ll have to do it his damn self!” said Fadiel Adams‚ referring to himself as a "gatvol Capetonian". Wednesday morning saw law enforcement officers move in and dismantle 111 structures. Parkwood protesters fought back with rocks and sticks. Tyres and trees were set alight during running battles with police. A man sheltering himself with an umbrella dropped what appeared to be a gun when running away from police fire. On closer inspection the weapon turned out to be a toy gun. One of the alleged protesters was shot in the face with a rubber bullet while sporadic violence flared up between police and protesters. City of Cape Town law enforcement spokesman Wayne Dyason said 12 men and five women were arrested for public violence in Parkwood and taken to Grassy Park police station.
