It's common knowledge that kids these days would rather have an unflattering haircut (the horror) than be on old "fuddy duddy" Facebook. The social media site that is populated with their moms and fake news rhetoric is as uncool as uncool can get. Besides the ever-popular WhatsApp and Instagram it would appear that a little-known app that started three years ago has now caught Generation Z's interest. Vero is a chronological app that allows its users to share and interact seamlessly with photos, links, music and more without the noise of ads or add-ons. And no ads apparently mean less data mining and more privacy. You can also listen to music and buy content seamlessly inside the app. WATCH | An introduction to Vero It's like Tumblr, Bandcamp, Instagram and WeChat had a baby - a very slick, pretty to look at, easy to use baby. But the most appealing aspect is it allows users to have control of who gets to see the content via "close friend", "friend" and "acquaintance" filters, but it doesn't prioritise content for you the way that Instagram does. Ever noticed that you keep seeing the same three random people's dog and baby pictures? No more, thanks to Vero. After the last few months of social media privacy trauma it's little wonder that the platform has mushroomed from 150,000 users to 3 million in a single week in March and the numbers continue to climb. But social media bubbles are "a thing", we saw the same numbers happen on Ello a few years back when the bubble burst as quickly as it started. Could Vero be the David to the Facebook Goliath or is it a star that is destined to burn out? My feeling is that there just aren't enough people over 24 on the app, and the temptation to quickly switch back to what and who we know is too easy.
