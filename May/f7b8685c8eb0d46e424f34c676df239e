In the fourth legal onslaught against the business rescue practitioners (BRP) overseeing Gupta companies, the CEO of Optimum and Koornfontein mines is now seeking a court order to have them removed. In court papers seen by Times Select, George Van der Merwe last week filed an application with the Pretoria High Court to remove Kurt Knoop and Louis Klopper. He slams them as “incompetent” and claims their actions are negatively affecting the businesses. This comes as Eskom last week had to inform the National Energy Regulator of SA it was facing shortages of coal at seven power stations. Eskom has blamed this on “historical underinvestment at cost-plus mines” and an undersupply of both quantity and quality of coal from Gupta-owned mines. It has denied reports that load shedding was imminent (read the full Eskom statement here). The two business rescue practitioners for the Optimum and Koornfontein mines were appointed by Gupta company directors on February 16 this year to oversee the business rescue process of both coal mines, and have fended off a series of court battles to have them removed.
