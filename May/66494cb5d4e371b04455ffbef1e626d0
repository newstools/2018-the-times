Akhumzi Jezile's memorial service which is currently underway at Rhema Bible Church in Randburg has been filled with emotionally-charged tributes, moving sermons and joyous celebrations of the life the TV personality lived. Hulisani Ravele whose friendship started with Akhumzi started years ago on YoTV had mourners laughing and shedding tears as she spoke fondly about her friend. "I loved his can do attitude and he could achieve anything." Hulisani remembered how Akhumzi's journey on YoTV started and how he kept pestering producers until he was given a chance as a guest presenter on the show. "As a colleague he constantly wanted to improve and be better, Akhumzi entered that door and he never looked back." Hulisani said that whenever she was co-presenting a show with Akhumzi she knew it was going to be lit. "Whenever you had an encounter with Akhumzi, you never left that encounter without laughing." She added that Akhumzi also showed up for his friends, whether it was a birthday or baby shower or his friends needed votes to win awards. "Thank you for sharing your son.Â Let us take his spirit and drive into all our careers, he never let the bright lights blind him. Akhumzi found his purpose in life and he was at the peak of harnessing that power. "
