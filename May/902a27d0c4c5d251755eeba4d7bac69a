Lexi Van often shares pictures of herself at the gym and has even had questions on whether she has become a personal trainer, after she publicly offered help to people. Now Lexi has described how tough her journey has been and how much she enjoys motivating other people to achieve their goals. "I was once extremely big and uncomfortable, or fat, whatever you wanna call that journey of an unhealthy lifestyle. Trust me, it wasn't easy. I started, I quit so many times but each day I'd come back with more drive and sulking but I'd go out and push harder." She said that she found certain classes tougher than others and while her body is not perfect, she loves it. "So these are a few of my pics since I decide to just start and push through. I'm not perfect but this is my imperfect body and I love it. It's my hard work and choices that made me fall in love with myself more than ever before. So choose to take care of yourself and don't stop moving." She shared some before and after pictures to serve some extra motivation and the results are incredible. The message is clear fam: fail and try again.
