Limpopo police believe that two lions and a tiger that were found dead on a farm in the Vaalwater area outside Lephalale in the early hours of Saturday might have been poisoned. The owner of the farm was awakened by his dogs’ barking and when he went outside to investigate‚ he found the cages where the lions and tiger were kept open. One lion was battling to breathe at the entrance while two others and a tiger were already dead‚ police said. “The police were summoned to the scene and reacted swiftly. The preliminary police investigations led to meat at the scene which suggested that it might have been laced with a poisonous substance. “The police investigations including the forensic ones will determine the exact cause of death to these animals‚” police said in a statement. They added that the suspects were unknown and that no arrests had been made yet.
