US-based comedian Trevor Noah said US president Donald Trump was a gift to every level of comedy. Noah had a discussion with CNN host Christiane Amanpour on a number of topics‚ ranging from the difference between Trump and former US president Barack Obama‚ the relevance of UK politics and the relationship between race and the establishment. On race and being black‚ Noah said the hardest thing for people to understand was that blackness was not homogeneous. “Black doesn't exist in one box. Black has many different shades. Black has many different experiences. Black as a signifier that has connected many people together because of what was imposed upon black‚ but the truth is black‚ in and of itself‚ has many different angles to it‚ and that's what's beautiful about it‚” Noah said.
