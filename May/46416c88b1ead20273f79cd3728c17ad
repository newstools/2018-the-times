Didier Drogba who was earlier today revealed as the mystery guest for the South African leg of the Heineken “Share the Drama” campaign said he was looking forward to “sharing the drama with the fans” at a special screening of the UCL final tonight when Real Madrid take on Liverpool in Kiev in the Ukraine. A previous winner of the prestigious competition himself, Drogba was reluctant to be drawn on  who he believed would win the match, merely saying he hopes the best team wins. “They are going to see emotions because the game is obviously going to be full of action, and I hope, goals.  It’s the Champions League final so, one of the biggest event in the world. Drogba was more forthcoming on who he hopes wins the hotly contested Balloon d”Or, naming Mo Salah. “He’s the new African King, and he’s been controlling the Premiere League. He’s been impressive.  Of course winning the champions League today for him would be a big thing. For his son, who recently joined a professional side in Frnca, and other aspirant footballers, Drogba had the following advice: "Believe in your potential and if you want to do something, go for it." Drogba, will be in and out of the country due to commitments with his current club Phoenix Rising.  He said South Africa holds a special place in his heart due the country's history.  "This place has meaning for me, and being close to the Mandela family will always bring me back here.  Also I have a lot of friends, and the first World Cup in Africa was here and that is something we will always remember."
