The department of home affairs extended heartfelt condolences on Monday to the family of a cancer patient who died while applying for a smart ID card at their offices in Cape Town. The frail 45-year-old man‚ assisted by family and staff‚ died while having his photograph taken at the Barrack Office. “On arrival‚ the family was assisted immediately from the vehicle by the office supervisor … With the help of the supervisor‚ the client was helped to alight from the vehicle and was taken straight into the office‚ to fulfil his request for an ID. He did not have to wait in a queue‚” said a statement by home affairs. “The man was issued first with a temporary ID so he could apply for a smart ID card‚ which process he had started when he gave his last breath in the photo booth.” The family said the temporary ID would enable them to give him a dignified burial. A death certificate would also be issued. “The department would like to thank officials at Barrack for their speedy response and for doing all in their power to assist the deceased as well as the family in their hour of need. Officials‚ who were visibly traumatised‚ are receiving counselling and other support from the department’s wellness team. “May our client’s soul rest in peace‚” said the department.
