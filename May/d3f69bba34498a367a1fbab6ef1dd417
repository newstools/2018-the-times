In the wake of Akmuzi Jezile's tragic death, one of his closest friends, Samkelo Ndlovu, is clinging onto the memories she shared with him. Those close to Akhumzi, Siyasanga Kobese and Thobani Mselini have been grappling to come to terms with their sudden deaths. The stars and two others were killed in a car crash outside Queenstown on Saturday morning. Samu told fans that she has been left gutted by Akhumzi's death, but is grateful to have known such "an awesomely great human". Along with a cute video of them fooling around in the pool, Samu paid a heart-warming tribute to her friend. "I miss you already.  I’m going to miss your unrelenting love. Our hour long video calls and your random, 'I’m at the gate' texts. I’m going to miss your humor and how you always made me feel so important to u. How much u loved God. How u lived life to the fullest." Samu said that through her grief she was comforted that she had the opportunity to know Akhumzi. "Every time I feel he tears coming, I remind myself of how lucky I am to have known such an awesomely great human that loved so fearlessly. Oh Xhamela."
