Roads have been blocked for a second consecutive night in the Cape Town city centre by protesters burning tyres. Wale Street‚ leading into the iconic Bo Kaap at the foot of Signal Hill‚ was closed on Tuesday evening. City of Cape Town law enforcement spokesperson Inspector Wayne Dyason said it was unclear what the protests were about. The protest comes in the wake of land grabs at locations across the Cape Town Metro‚ including in Grassy Park and Parkwood‚ where people trying to occupy land have clashed violently with police and in some cases have destroyed private property. This is a developing story.
