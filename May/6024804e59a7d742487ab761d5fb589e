Parliament has expressed its condolences on the death of legendary photographer Sam Nzima. “Parliament’s presiding officers‚ on behalf of Parliament‚ extend our deep condolences on the passing away of Mr Sam Nzima‚ the iconic and brave photographer‚ who so vividly captured the brutality of apartheid rule in his photograph of Hector Pieterson‚ shot by police on 16 June 1976.” “The photograph‚ published widely‚ helped force the world to take notice and act against a government‚ prepared to kill even children so that it could continue enforcing its oppressive policies of racial discrimination and oppression.” Parliament said Nzima belonged to a generation of photographers who used the power of the camera lens to make an immense contribution to the struggle against a repressive regime. “We are saddened by Mr Nzima’s passing and our thoughts are with Mr Nzima’s family and friends at this time of loss and grieving.” Nzima died in a Nelspruit hospital in Mpumalanga on Saturday evening‚ sources close to the family told TimesLIVE. He was 83 years old.
