Gauteng MEC for human settlements Uhuru Moiloa says he understands the frustrations of Eldorado Park residents and other communities in southern Johannesburg over delays in housing delivery. Moiloa held a meeting with community leaders on Thursday but it collapsed as the leaders walked out complaining he was merely providing “updates on old promises”. "It was a difficult meeting which is understandable because the communities are agitated‚" Moiloa told journalists. Moiloa said there were delays in the implementation of promises which were made by his predecessor‚ Paul Mashatile. The delays‚ he said‚ were caused by the fact that some of the projects promised were not covered in the current budget of the department. But Moiloa said these had been included in the new R5.7-billion budget already allocated to the provincial department of human settlements. Moiloa said he had already spoken to Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba to get human settlement plans of both spheres of government aligned and make the provision of bulk infrastructure more efficient. Residents in the deep south of Johannesburg started protesting this week‚ demanding housing and development in their areas.
