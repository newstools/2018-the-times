Two young men are expected to start their adult life in a prison cell after they were convicted or murdering a train driver in Cape Town. Metrorail train driver Piet Botha was shot dead while waiting for a train to take him home to Malmesbury‚ north of Cape Town‚ in July 2016. After he had spent the day training a junior train driver‚ he was approached by Jatheme Hamid‚ Dorian Diedericks and Cedric Andrews on the platform at Netreg station in Bonteheuwel. Hamid and Diedericks shot and killed Botha with an Uzi sub-machine-gun and another semi-automatic firearm after robbing him of his cellphones and bag. They were only 16 and 18 at the time of the incident‚ and the Cape Town High Court also found that they were part of the Young Dixie Boys gang. On Wednesday‚ the court found Hamid and Diedericks — now 18 and 19 respectively — guilty of murder‚ robbery‚ possession of an illegal firearm‚ possession of illegal ammunition‚ and gang related charges falling under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. Andrews‚ 39‚ was found guilty of possessing illegal firearms and ammunition. Western Cape police spokesman Captain FC van Wyk said the case was postponed until July 19 for a probation officer’s report. “The thorough investigation of crime and the bringing of perpetrators before court are crucial in the efforts of the SAPS to ensure convictions. This was again confirmed by the guilty finding in a murder case which was investigated by Nyanga detectives‚” said Van Wyk. Metrorail spokeswoman Riana Scott said the company welcomed the guilty verdicts. "[We] trust that the sentencing will send out a clear message that crime will not be tolerated‚" she said.
