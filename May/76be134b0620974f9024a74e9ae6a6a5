Three men and two women appeared in the Palm Ridge Magistrate's Court on Monday afternoon in connection with the kidnapping of 13-month-old Eden Laird last week. They were not asked to plead and their case was postponed until Tuesday‚ May 15‚ for further investigation. The legal status of the accused will also be investigated to ensure their paperwork is in order. Four of the suspects are Zimbabwean nationals. The prosecution indicated that the five are facing charges of kidnapping and extortion. The three men have employed private attorneys‚ while the two women asked for Legal Aid representation. Thirteen-month-old Laird went missing on May 2. Police arrested the suspects on Friday after they had demanded a ransom for the release of the baby. The state opposed bail.
