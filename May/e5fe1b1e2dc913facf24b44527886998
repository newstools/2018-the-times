Metrorail has announced it will operate a free train service for fans attending the Sundowns versus Barcelona game on Wednesday evening from Pretoria to Soweto's Soccer City stadium. The same trains from Pretoria will pick up soccer fans at Johannesburg Station to Nasrec. Fans must have match tickets to access the trains. Another service to catch the game is the Rea Vaya service‚ which began to resume its operations on Tuesday after being paralyzed by a 27-day strike by workers. The service advised its early customers: "We are currently operating Phase 1B buses from Soweto through Auckland Park and Parktown to the Joburg CBD. We are waiting drivers for Phase 1A to resume work during the day." Rea Vaya stations open from 5am‚ and run until 9pm with a frequency of five minutes during peak times (05:00- 8:30)‚ and 30 minutes off peak (8:31- 14:59). The Metrobus service was slow to restart on Tuesday morning‚ disappointing its regular commuters. The five unions involved in the labour action did advise on Monday night that drivers are officially only expected to return to work on Wednesday. The unions declared on Monday night that they had accepted a wage increment offer of 9% across-the-board. The offer is effective from the beginning of April this year‚ while a second pay rise increment of 8% will be implemented from April 2019. There will also be allowances‚ including night shift and subsistence‚ over both years.
