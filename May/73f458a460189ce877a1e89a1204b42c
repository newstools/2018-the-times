The ANC has conceded that it’s at risk of obtaining less than 50% of votes in next year’s general elections. This is according to an internal party document that was presented at the ANC’s elections workshop in March this year. The document has been kept under wraps — until now. In the confidential document, the ANC admits that it risks obtaining no more than 50% of votes even with President Cyril Ramaphosa as the face of its campaign. The party has been on an electoral decline since 2014, largely because of  the scandal-prone administration that was led by former president Jacob Zuma. The document warns that, unless drastic action is taken, the ANC would not garner enough votes to form an outright majority in parliament, which the party requires to remain in government without the support of other parties. The documents states “available research” shows that the ANC’s approval ratings plummeted to less than 50% last year. In the 2016 local government elections, the ANC was wrestled out of power in key metro municipalities including Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay by its opponents.
