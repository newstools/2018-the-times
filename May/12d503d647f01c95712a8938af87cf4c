Before Mziwoxolo came along, Brutus was the main fave uncle in The Queen. While fans were initially worried that Mzi (played by veteran actor Vusi Thanda) would take the spotlight away from Brutus (played by Themba Ndaba), others have chosen to appreciate both uncles after they eventually realised that the pair were in the same WhatsApp group. Both uncles are hilarious and even though others may think comparing them is like comparing apples and oranges, they are both still fruits. There's really no need to worry that one will cancel out the other and we have highlighted three reasons why both uncles are great for entertainment. It's really a win for viewers. Brutus told Shaka to get over the love of his life because according to him "she's just another skirt" and Mzi said he's just helping his niece get married for his profit share. Both uncles can't and won't be separatedÂ from their alcohol. Remember their reactions when Mzi found out that Madi was still a virgin or when Brutus encouraged his nephew to be a player!
