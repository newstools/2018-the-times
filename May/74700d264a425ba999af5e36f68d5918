A group of young men have found creative inspiration in Julius Malema's words at the late anti-apartheid stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's funeral a few weeks ago. The group have composed a song in Sepedi praising the EFF leader. They call him a boss for calling on Madikizela-Mandela to send him a signal. Below is a roughÂ translation of the song: Julius is a Nkalakatha Juju (echo) is boss of the bosses He even asks for a signal from Mama Madikizela-Mandela (x2) (Holding an imaginary phone up to their ears) Mama, mama, mama, mama (echo) We ask for a signal from Mama Madikizela-Mandela (x3)
