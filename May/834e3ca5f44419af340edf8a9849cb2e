Kylie Jenner did her first interview since giving birth to her daughter, Stormi, and it was her sister, Kim Kardashian, who was asking the questions. The two sat down for a Q &A for Evening Standard magazine and chatted everything from baby names to plastic surgery. While we've all been wondering how Kylie and her baby daddy, Travis Scott, named their daughter, it seems even Kylie doesn't know. "I really don't know how we thought of Stormi. Her dad insisted it was him, but I feel like it was me. And that kind of just stuck with us. And then I didn't really like just Storm. I didn't feel like that was her name. So then it became Stormi. And it just stuck." She said that since giving birth, life has been "amazing" and she's learning a lot about herself. "Of course there's hard times and stuff. Even in the beginning, just not sleeping, the nights, like, baby blues and all the ups and downs. And also, even when I'm here, it was so hard to leave this morning. I'm like, 'I'll be right back! I'm so sorry, I have to leave!' and she doesn't even know what's going on." Although she has previously admitted to getting her lips done, Kyle said that she was happy with herself at the moment. "I feel like if it makes you feel better, and if that's what you want to do, I'm not against it. Right now, I probably wouldn't do anything, actually."
