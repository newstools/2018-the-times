The ANC wants government to immediately use section 25 of the Constitution to expropriate land without compensation. Addressing a media conference at Luthuli House on Tuesday‚ ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule said the party had requested its sub-committees to come up with a programme of action in the next two months in order to undertake expropriation in an orderly fashion. Magashule said the party had adopted the report of the land summit which had discussed the matter two weeks ago. "[The NEC has resolved to] immediately use section 25 of the Constitution to press ahead with the expropriation of land in order to test the argument that the Constitution does permit expropriation of land without compensation‚" said Magashule. He said should it be found that the section impeded expropriation without compensation‚ the party had resolved that the Constitution would then be changed. This has been an argument made by a number of legal minds, including judges and advocates specialising in constitutional matters. Advocate Tembela Ngcukaitobi‚ who recently published his book "The Land is Ours"‚ has also made similar arguments. Magashule said the party also wanted to accelerate both the Land Expropriation and the Land Restitution Bills in order to bring about greater clarity. "The NEC calls for a broader-based public participation of all South Africans in the Constitutional review process‚" said Magashule. He said the NEC had called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to move swiftly and appoint an expert panel on land reform. "We have called on our municipalities to ensure that they give people service sites so that we speed up this programme of expropriation of land without compensation‚" added Magashule.
