Alex Ferguson, the most successful manager in Manchester United's history, underwent emergency surgery on Saturday for a brain haemorrhage, the club said. "The procedure has gone very well but he needs a period of intensive care to optimise his recovery," a statement said. "His family request privacy in this matter." His son Darren, the manager of Doncaster Rovers, was reported to have missed his team's match on Saturday for family reasons. The 76-year-old was United manager from 1986 to 2013, winning the Champions League twice and the Premier League 13 times.
