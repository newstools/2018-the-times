Acting Judge Peet Johnson was scathing in his sentencing of convicted murderer Sandile Mantsoe on Thursday. Mantsoe was convicted on Wednesday of the murder of his girlfriend Karabo Mokoena‚ whose charred remains were found in a ditch in Lyndhurst on April 28 last year. The forex trader continues to maintain that he returned to his apartment to find that she had committed suicide by stabbing herself in the neck. Johnson handed Mantsoe a three-decade-long jail term for assault and murder as well as disposing of Mokoena's body. “The court cannot describe you in any other way but as a devil in disguise‚” Johnson said as he read through his judgment in the High Court in Johannesburg. “I am guessing you thought that your riches would get you everywhere but they got you nowhere‚” he added.
