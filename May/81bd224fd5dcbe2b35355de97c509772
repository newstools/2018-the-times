A woman was killed and 14 other people injured on Tuesday afternoon when a taxi rear-ended a truck on the N3 at the N12 Geldenhuys Split in Germiston‚ east of Johannesburg. ER24 spokesman Russel Meiring said ER24 paramedics‚ along with other services‚ had arrived on the scene at 1.30pm to find the taxi in the right-hand lane and the truck in the left-hand lane. Several people were found lying around the taxi. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that one woman had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately‚ nothing could be done for her and she was declared dead on the scene. “Fourteen other patients were assessed on the scene. Three were found in a critical condition while eleven others had sustained minor to moderate injuries‚” Meiring said. “Paramedics treated the patients for their injuries and provided the three critically injured with advanced life support interventions. Once treated‚ the patients were transported to various hospitals for urgent treatment‚” he added.
