Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle has assigned Education MEC Mandla Makupula to investigate nudity on stage during a school choir competition. A video showing choristers singing and dancing with their buttocks and breasts exposed has led to members of the public expressing their disappointment that event organisers allowed pupils to perform in this exposed manner‚ the Daily Dispatch reports. The nudity occurred during a segment referencing a Xhosa tradition. The choir master was quoted as saying they stood by their decision for some of the lead singers to take off their traditional blankets (umbhaco) and dance with only inkciyo (small aprons). “We are proud of our Xhosa tradition. We are proud of inkciyo. We are proud of Xhosa women and girls‚” the Dispatch quoted him as saying. - Daily Dispatch
