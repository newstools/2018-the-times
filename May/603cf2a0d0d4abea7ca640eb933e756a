The news of the triple celebrity deaths of Akhumzi Jezile, Thobani Mseleni, Siyasanga Kobese and two others is still the only thing on the minds of many in Mzansi. But Joyous Celebration loyalists have resorted to going back to their archives to re-live the amazing presence of Siyasanga. Before Siya made a name for herself as an actress, she was known to many as the woman from Joyous celebration that took an old hymn and made it her own. The song Noya Na? is a traditional Christian song that has been sung a million different ways, but when Siyasanga took the lead vocals, it became a gospel hit. The lyrics to the song which tells the journey of going home to heaven has become a reminder of the energetic performer Siyasanga became known for. Sikuyo indlela yelizwe lobomi[We're in a journey to the land of life]Ikhaya labantu bahleli ngenyweba[Home to the priviledged]Nina ke nahluka kuThixo ngokona[You drifted away from God by sin]Nithini? Noya na?[What do you say? Will you go?]Noya na phezulu?[Will you go to heaven?] Siyasanga's fan base grew with her and by the time she took to Joyous Celebration 17 to perform her heart out with the song Hay' Inyweba, she had legions of adoring fans. She lived to praise God with her talents and she enjoyed it.
