AB de Villiers has called time on his international career‚ announcing his retirement on his app on Wednesday. The South Africa star said he had “no plans to play overseas”. “It’s not about earning more somewhere else‚” De Villiers said in a video clip. “ "It’s about running out of gas and feeling that it’s time to move on.” De Villiers played 114 Tests‚ 228 one-day internationals and 78 T20 internationals. Cricket South Africa president, Chris Nenzani said: “AB is one of the all-time greats of South African cricket who has thrilled spectators around the world with his sheer brilliance, coupled to his ability to innovate and take modern day batting in all three formats but particularly in the white ball ones to new levels. "It goes without saying that he is going to be greatly missed wherever international cricket is played." Cricket SA acting chief executive, Thabang Moroe, says it is a disappointing decision but one that is respected. “AB has been a colossus on the world stage for well over a decade and we are indeed grateful that most of this time he has been wearing the colours of our beloved Standard Bank Proteas.”
