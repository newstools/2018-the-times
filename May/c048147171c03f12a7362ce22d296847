While we've all seen the snaps from Pearl Thusi's birthday party, a touching speech from the personality to Bassie Kumalo has just been revealed. In a video posted to Instagram, Pearl tears up as she tells the story of how Bassie bought her flights and hired her a car so she could bury her grandmother. "The first laptop I have owned was from her. I buried my grandmother because of her. I didn't have money to go bury my grandmother and she bought me and my daughter flights and hired us a car so I could lay my grandmother to rest." In the video caption Pearl said that it was an honour to celebrate with people who have made her who she is. Watch the touching video below.
