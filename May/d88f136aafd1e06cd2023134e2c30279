Hulisani Ravele, a close friend of Akhumzi Jezile, found out from a caller that Akhumzi had died. She detailed how she was working when someone called to say Akhumzi had died in a car accident. "Me: Hey! Caller: You good? Me: Yeah. Caller: You sure? Me: Aha, why?Caller: Just heardÂ  about Akhumzi. Me: What about him? Caller: He passed away." Hulisani said she didn't believe it, even when she saw a hashtag with his name and RIP. " Seeing a # with RIP and your name after that, sent a chilling pain through my body. It was true. It is true." Hulisani went back and found an old email from Akhumzi where he had answered questions about himself. It was two questions that he answered that left her devastated. "If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go? Akhumzi: 'Heaven, but only if I can come back.' What are you afraid of? Akhumzi: 'Losing the people I love.'" Hulisani said she might eventually smile but not right now. "You introduced me to Joyous' 'In The Shadow of His Wings' with Ntokozo Mbambo as the lead, I always told you how that song reminded me of you. It still does. It always will. It's just that right now it won't put a smile on my face and fill my heart with happy memories of you. I know one day it will again, just not today." You can read her full post here.
