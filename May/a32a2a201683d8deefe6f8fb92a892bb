The national bus strike officially ended on Monday. Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) national spokesperson, confirmed the end of the strike. Details, however, were still sketchy, with officials locked in meetings. Greyhound and Citiliner announced on social media that their bus services would start resuming from Monday - with all routes operational from Wednesday. Commuters have been advised to ensure they check with callcentres or offices for details. “We would like to apologise to all of our passengers who have been affected by the nationwide bus strike and we look forward to welcoming you again on our coaches,” Greyhound said on its Facebook page. The end of the strike comes after a more than month-long strike action over remuneration. It appeared that an agreement over wages - which included a 9% wage increase for year one‚ an 8% increase for year two and various allowances - had been reached on Friday, but a sticking point was over when the deal would take effect. Employers wanted the deal to kick in from the date of signing the agreement, but unions wanted it to take effect from the date the strike started. This is a developing story.
