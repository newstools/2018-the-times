Suspended SARS boss Tom Moyane may be prosecuted for assault after the teenage mother of his six-month-old grandson accused him of attacking her at his Johannesburg home last week. Police this week confirmed that Moyane had been warned to be present at the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Friday when a prosecutor would decide whether to charge him with common assault. Moyane allegedly kicked the 17-year-old, who is known to the Sunday Times, in the face “like a Ninja” and “rugby-tackled” her during an argument at a home in Weltevreden Park, Johannesburg. The house is owned by Moyane and his wife, Thandi. He allegedly screamed at the woman, accused her of witchcraft and blamed her for destroying his “empire”. A medical report by a doctor at Helen Joseph Hospital dated May 15 shows she suffered a bruised jaw, a cut to the inside of a cheek and a bruised abdomen. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
