From Basetsana Kumalo to Pearl Thusi to Claire Mawisa, celebs and influencers turned out in their droves for the 60th Miss South Africa pageant, which took place on Sunday at the Sun Arena at Time Square in Pretoria. While we couldn't wait to find out which of the Miss SA 2018 finalists would win the crown, we were equally interested to see which A-listers' would be winners and losers in the red carpet fashion stakes. Here's our pick of the best and worst dressed: Things are not usually so black and white, but there is no grey area here: Basetsana Kumalo's layered dress was a mixed fabric misstep. Beading, fringed trim, two different colours ... there's just too much going on here. According to The Namibian, award-winning stylist Reinhard Mahalie is a regular fixture on the country's red carpets, where he dresses in drag to breakdown gender barriers in the fashion industry. While we applaud his effort to make a bold statement about a social issue, we can't commend his outfit. His pink ruffled creation looked more like an over-whipped meringue than a red-carpet masterpiece. Yes, Pearl Thusi's dress had a lot going on here in terms of detailing, but there's something really alluring about it. We can't help but wonder, though, if it wouldn't have worked better as a cocktail dress, cut off at the knee where the black part of the shimmering skirt ends. The abstract floral print on the skirt gave TV personality Calire Mawisa's classic white gown a contemporary edge. With a fitted top, sparkling embellishments at the waist, and an A-line skirt, the design also flattered her figure beautifully. The former Miss SA's pairing of a crop top and full, floor-length skirt was bang on trend. It was figure flattering, bold and beautiful.
