Twenty Chatsworth residents spent the night under the same roof as a man who is accused of being involved in the killing of nine-year-old Sadia Sukhraj. Police spokeswoman Captain Nqobile Gwala confirmed that officers had arrested 20 people‚ who were among hundreds who had gathered outside the Chatsworth police station on Monday night. Video footage of the incident showed protesters hurling stones at police‚ the officers responding with rubber bullets‚ teargas and stun grenades to disperse the group. The protesters were detained along with a 39-year-old accused of playing a role in the hijacking of Shailendra Sukhraj‚ the slain girl's father. The nine-year-old was in the back seat of the car. One of the alleged accomplices was killed and another escaped after they crashed the stolen car into a truck‚ and finally came to rest in a neighbourhood park. The injured girl‚ found lying in the car‚ is understood to have been rushed to the hospital where she later died. Her funeral and burial will take place on Tuesday. Gwala said that those detained for public violence‚ as well the alleged hijacker‚ would likely appear in court on Wednesday.
