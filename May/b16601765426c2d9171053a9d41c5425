The 38-year-old victim is in a critical condition, suffering from a severe head injury following the attack in Strabane, County Tyrone, at around 2am on Saturday. "A 17-year-old male has been charged with grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and theft of a drill," said the Police Service of Northern Ireland. "This was a brutal attack and the injuries sustained by the victim are extremely grave," said the PSNI's Brian Reid. The suspect is expected to appear at Omagh magistrates' court on Monday.
