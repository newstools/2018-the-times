Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane has welcomed the sentence imposed on a man who killed the manager of Sakhumzi restaurant in Soweto. On Friday the South Gauteng High Court sentenced Njabulo Ngubane to life imprisonment for the murder of Khwesi Hudson. He was also sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment for robbery and aggravating circumstances‚ ten years for illegal possession of a firearm and three years for possession of ammunition. In January 2017‚ the eatery was robbed of an undisclosed amount of cash after the robbers gained entry as the restaurant was cashing up for the day. Nkosi-Malobane said: “It is extremely critical that our law enforcement agencies must do good preparatory work for cases to secure conviction of perpetrators during court appearances. I urge the Gauteng law enforcement agencies to continue to work diligently to protect the citizens of this province. “We hope that the sentencing of this heartless criminal will send a strong message to criminals out there that the criminal justice system will not hesitate to impose harsher sentences to those found guilty of such atrocious crimes."
