Just a few hours after the news of Maps Maponyane and Nomzamo Mbatha's split, the pair took to Twitter to, uhm, clear the air/dismiss reports/divert attention/put out the fire/do damage control (pick one and go with it). The buddyship, which has been #couplegoals for many people in Mzansi (even though they never officially admitted to being romantically linked), topped the trends list on Monday after TshisaLIVE revealed they had split. While the team #buddies squad was minding their own business, they were shocked to find out that Maps and Nomzamo were over. What made the pair a cool "couple" to begin with was the fact that their friendship vibe was too cool for the game. They seemed to have mastered the language of secret codes and sarcasm. So Nomzamo asked her honourable buddy if he was okay... Twitter was not going to be swayed that easily though. While some were honestly relieved that it appeared like the pair seemed to be brushing off the split speculation, others were looking for fire because "where there's smoke there's fire."
