Nelson Mandela Bay ANC councillor Andile Lungisa has been sentenced to two years’ direct imprisonment for the attack on DA councillor Rano Kayser during a heated council meeting in October 2016. Handing down sentence in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, magistrate Morne Cannon said it was clear Lungisa showed no remorse for his actions, even when testifying during mitigation of sentencing, HeraldLIVE reported. In April, Lungisa was found guilty of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court. Cannon said he proved to be a poor witness who changed his version of events as the trial proceeded. Lungisa was found to have unlawfully and intentionally hit Kayser over the head with a glass water jug without provocation. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment with one year suspended. His co-accused‚ Gamalihleli Maqula‚ was acquitted on all charges in March when the court found that there was not enough evidence against him for conviction. Lungisa will appeal against the conviction and sentence at 3pm on Wednesday.
