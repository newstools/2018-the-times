Passengers had to be evacuated from a train which pulled into a station with two carriages engulfed in flames‚ in Cape Town on Tuesday. Rob Beezy tweeted video footage of the burning carriages at Retreat station. “The fire on board train number 0133 en route to Simon’s Town gutted two carriages and the adjoining two suffered minor damages‚” said Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott. “Preliminary reports from the scene indicate that all commuters on board were evacuated at Retreat station. No injuries were reported. The high voltage overhead power [was] switched off to enable the fire brigade to extinguish the fire and our train crew separated the burning carriages from the rest of the train to prevent further damage.” “The fire was doused at 09:45h. Both lines were initially closed but one has subsequently been reopened after safety checks‚ and trains were diverted. Final mopping up operations will commence as soon as the forensic teams have completed their investigation and the damaged carriages will be taken to the depot for further investigation and assessment by Prasa’s loss adjusters. It is not yet possible to say what the cost of the damage is going to be.” Cape Town’s Fire and Rescue spokesperson Theo Layne said two fire engines‚ a water tanker and a rescue vehicle were deployed to the scene.
