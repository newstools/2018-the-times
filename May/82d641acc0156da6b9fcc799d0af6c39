Just months after AKA once again spoke about cheating on his baby mama with Bonang Matheba, he has shared his thoughts on why people cheat. We're not sure if he was using personal experience or the experiences of others, but the dude really wanted to get ish off his chest. He later deleted the rant, but we got the 'grabs. So, pull up a seat and listen to his state of the nation on relationships. "There is no amount of money that can stop a woman from cheating on you because there is always someone with more". "There's no amount of good p****, loyalty or care that will stop your man from cheating on you...because stupid n***** always want more." So, according to the Mega, we are all screwed. "Instagram f*cked it up for everybody. Basically, everyone's up to sh*t and it's all Instagram's fault. We see you slay queens and Insta-daddies!
