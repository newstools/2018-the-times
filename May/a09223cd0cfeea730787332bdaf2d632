ANC topdog Gwede "Uncle Gweezy" Mantashe has really changed up his style and dress sense over the last while and now he jokingly wants the pictures of the old Gweezy removed before they " damage" his party's chances at the polls. According to Fikile Mbalula, Gweezy randomly gatecrashed a strategy meeting at Luthuli House this week and wanted to know if everyone approved of his new style. In a video shared online, Uncle Gweezy is seen talking to people in the meeting and joking that his new style will do nothing for the party's image if the old ones of him are not removed. “If you continue posting the picture of that suit that covers the shoes, we're going to lose the elections,” Mantashe said to roars of laughter. Mantashe, who is known to have a wicked sense of humour, continued by recounting how Zuma would often laugh at his style. "I would sit there and the former president Jacob Zuma would burst out in laughter. Remove that picture from social media,” he added. While you might have forgotten about the pics he was talking about, the internet doesn't. The Twitter CSI was on it and soon posted all of the pics malume wants erased. We were just there like... Yaz! Social media was howling at uncle Gweezy's "predicament" and even suggested he hire Babes to solve his problems.
