In November 2017 Nomzamo Mbatha was announced as a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHRC) ambassador. Her role is to "educate and influence the cause of tolerance, acceptance and unity." Nomzamo was recently in South Sudan and aimed to raise awareness about the plight of refugees there. "5 years of civil war have resulted in a humanitarian crisis affecting 7 million people, more than half the population. Causing millions to flee for refuge and seek asylum in refugee camps," she wrote on Twitter. Nomzamo also shared some heart-warming moments of her time. In one video, she is seen braiding a girl's hair. In another video Nomzamo gives people a taste of her dance skills. She also visited a school in one of the refugee camps and said she was greeted with South African flags.
