Thandi Modise, chairwoman of the National Council of Provinces, is said to be the favourite to replace Supra Mahumapelo as North West premier. The Sunday Times understands that Modise has been approached to go back to her old job as the ANC tries to put out the fires in the North West. But it has emerged that although Mahumapelo agreed in his meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday to resign as premier, he vowed to fight to stay chairman of the ANC in the province. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule told the Sunday Times that talk about Modise’s return was a rumour. Calls for Mahumapelo to step down come after violent protests in parts of the province where residents complained about the lack of service delivery and rampant corruption in the premier’s administration. The national government intervened by putting the provincial health department under administration. Ramaphosa is said to be pushing for Mahumapelo to step down as ANC provincial chairman too and to dissolve the provincial executive committee. “Supra is going to fight tooth and nail to remain as provincial chairperson because without this position he is naked and vulnerable,” said a senior source with knowledge of the matter.” Read the full stoory in the Sunday Times.
