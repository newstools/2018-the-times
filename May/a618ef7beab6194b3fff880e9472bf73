Illovo Sugar South Africa warned job seekers on Tuesday about an employment scam run by fraudsters who are offering bogus jobs at the company in exchange for cash. The sugar producer said it was “seriously concerned” about the employment scam targeting job seekers in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. “Perpetrators‚ posing as representatives from Illovo Sugar South Africa‚ are approaching potential job hunters with fake offers of employment at the company. These fraudsters are requesting a costly‚ upfront payment before the fraudulent ‘recruitment’ process can be finalised‚” the company said a statement. “Scammers are engaging with individuals face-to-face‚ telephonically and through various unofficial email platforms and website domains that are in no way affiliated to Illovo Sugar South Africa‚ nor to its holding company‚ Illovo Sugar Africa.” The company said it would never ask for or collect cash payments while recruiting staff. “We are working with the relevant authorities to close down these fraudulent activities and to bring those responsible to book. Equally‚ we encourage members of the public to also report any suspicious activity or advertisements to the police - and for those who may be impacted to formally open a case at their nearest police station.” Job seekers were urged to submit their CVs through official company channels.
