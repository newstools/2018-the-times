A lawyer from a top Sandton firm admitted on Thursday to dumping a dead family Labrador dog on the side of the road. The man was caught on CCTV footage opening the boot of his Mercedes Benz‚ and glancing around before dumping the animal carcass on a quiet suburban street. In a teleconference held at the law offices‚ the man admitted to dumping the carcass of his family dog. He then agreed to meet with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) when he returned to Johannesburg next week‚ saying he was attending a funeral in the Northern Cape. The Sandton SPCA is in the process of laying criminal charges for illegal dumping‚ in terms of the by-laws of the City of Johannesburg. The SPCA said it was stunned by the behaviour of a leading member of the legal fraternity‚ and for his attitude towards a beloved family pet. “The lack of respect for an animal - even for one who had died - and the lack of respect for legislation‚ especially by someone who should be upholding the law‚ leaves us speechless‚” said Jaco Pieterse‚ spokesperson for Sandton SPCA. The law firm has since distanced itself from the incident. “We discussed the matter with the individual concerned and have satisfied ourselves that this is a personal matter that does not involve the Firm. We understand the individual is cooperating fully with the SPCA,” said the spokesperson from the law firm.
