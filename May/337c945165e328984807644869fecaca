Mining companies are going to fork out about R5-billion to mineworkers after an historic class action settlement was reached on Thursday with those suffering from silicosis and tuberculosis. The settlement was the first of its kind in South Africa. It was reached between the Legal Resources Centre‚ Abrahams Kiewitz Inc and Richard Spoor Attorneys‚ who represented thousands of mineworkers‚ and the Occupational Lung Disease (OLD) Working Group‚ who represented African Rainbow Minerals‚ Anglo American SA‚ AngloGold Ashanti‚ Gold Fields‚ Harmony‚ Sibanye Stillwater and Pan African Resources. “The companies will make an initial contribution for benefit payments of R1.4-billion for the first two years of benefit payments‚” the Legal Resources Centre said in a media statement. The draft settlement was signed at Sunnyside Park Hotel‚ Parktown‚ Johannesburg‚ and will provide a medical examination and compensation to mineworkers who worked in gold mines from March 12‚ 1965‚ to date. The High Court in Johannesburg will now review the draft settlement. Once it has been approved‚ a trust deed will be set up. “There is no limit on the number of potential claimants. Individuals will be entitled to opt out if they do not wish to participate in the settlement‚” the LRC said. The parties compromised and reached a settlement out of concern for the “inevitably lengthy and expensive litigation”. Silicosis is a progressive disease of the lungs caused by breathing in silica dust in gold mines‚ which can lead to tuberculosis. There are ten different kinds of claimants: Mineworkers’ benefits will increase annually in line with the consumer price index (CPI) from the third year of the trust. Mining companies agreed to contribute R845-million in administration costs to the trust. The Legal Resources Centre said mining companies have made progress in underground dust prevention‚ but must continue improving to prevent future silicosis and tuberculosis in gold mining.
