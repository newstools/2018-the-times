So, what do you do when you are tired of playing the field and want to take a ncinyane break? Well according to bachelor Raymond, you get off the pitch and move into coaching. Raymond Matosa was looking for real love and after finding some horrible relationships in hopeless places, he went to Date My Family to try his luck. We should have known that trouble was coming when Raymond introduced himself by saying his nickname was sniper, but by then it was too late because Raymond had already engaged player mode. Boy didn't waste time in telling everyone he met that he was no longer a player and was now a coach, but the people wanted the slips and police-stamped affidavits as proof. We get that boy has a list of things he is looking for in a girl, such as: Ambitious Shorter than him Good-looking "Thick" 32-34 But that didn't stop the "player" from romancing and even asking for a second date with Thato. Because rule number one in the player's handbook is "have no regrets". Yas, like sis said, a leopard never changes its stripes.
