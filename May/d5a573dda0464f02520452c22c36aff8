Tjo! Tjo! Tjo! That is all we could say after we heard AKA drop bars that seemed to be dissing the hell out of his ex bae, Bonang. In the video, AKA seems to be entertaining a small crowd of fans as he was getting into a car. He begins freestyling for the enthusiastic crowd and as they hype him up he dropped the diss that got Bonang trending on Twitter for most of Wednesday night. "Waited two years just to see you with your weave off... What that say about your character, you was f**king me while I was paying damages," AKA raps in the video. Bonang and AKA began seeing each other while he was still with DJ Zinhle. Zinhle and AKA were expecting their first child together and later Zinhle wrote in a blog that she found out about the relationship while she was pregnant. Despite the initial hate and criticism thrown their way, Bonang and AKA stuck it out and eventually came out about their relationship. They instantly became #couplegoals and publicly declared their love to each other. Two years later, the cracks in their relationship began showing with a lot of speculation that their relationship was on the rocks. After publicity stunt "fights", B being AKA's music video vixen and AKA featuring in Being Bonang, the pair took to social media to announce officially that they were no longer together. It looked amicable, with both of them not saying anything about their split. Then in the second season of her reality show, B opened up about breaking up. "Let me tell you how I dealt with my break-up. You cry and cry and cry." In January AKA said he wouldn't speak about their relationship. "If I was any less of a guy‚ I would just stand here and tell you the whole story. But I think when you love somebody and you respect somebody‚ you leave that type of stuff between each other." But after this video was leaked, everyone is assuming that his upcoming Touch My Blood album will be litty for Queen B. Ayeye!
