Parliament announced on Tuesday that it had reached a settlement with the former head of its Parliamentary Protection Services‚ Zelda Holtzman to “part ways cordially”. It also involved Parliament withdrawing its charges against Holtzman and a decision to dismiss her. In terms of the settlement‚ Holtzman would be paid her gross salary equivalent to a period of eight months‚ it said. “Parliament dismissed Ms Holtzman last year after a disciplinary inquiry found her guilty on several charges. However‚ she challenged the decision at the CCMA and it was there that the parties opted‚ instead‚ to settle amicably‚” Parliament said in a statement. Charges for which Holtzman was dismissed related to her refusal to provide written responses and a report to her manager‚ as per a lawful instruction given to her‚ it said. “It also related to her failure to produce a strategic business plan – in line with and in support of Parliament’s strategic plan (a statutory requirement) – and to submit an annual budget. “Today’s agreement brings the long‚ drawn-out dispute to an end and also ends any relationship between Parliament and Ms Holtzman‚” the statement read.
