Shortly after it emerged on Monday that Maps Maponyane and Nomzamo Mbatha had split, Twitter immediately went into a meltdown. Just who would they look up to as the CEO of the Boyfriend Academy? Organisations don't do well without a commander-in-chief and Twitter immediately appointed ProVerb. Except, well, he didn't apply for the position. And he ain't to keen about stepping into the role. So, he resigned. Effective immediately. "As the newly appointed acting CEO of the Boyfriend Academy of South Africa (or whatever it's called) the first law I wish to pass is to challenge everyone to live their own lives. Now thank you for the honour but please accept my resignation with immediate effect. I refuse to live my life with your pressure and unrealistic expectations. I thank you. As you were." Sommer an "as you were" thrown in there too? Sjoe. Peeps were not having it. They convened all members of the company and flooded his comments section in an attempt to convince him to take back the job. Because who wouldn't want to have that kind of pressure of being the perfect guy? And when your private life is a mess and becomes public, sorry for them, right? *sarcastic voice* Leave Pro be, fam. Running corporations aren't for everyone. That doesn't mean he ain't a businessman.
