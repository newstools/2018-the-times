When you are filling up with petrol or at a nightclub‚ you are potentially at risk. And with about 85 hijackings a day in South Africa - the equivalent of four every hour - this is good reason to be aware of danger and to take precautions where possible. “Hijackers are pouncing on unsuspecting vehicle owners wherever the opportunity presents itself‚” commented Warwick Scott-Rodger‚ executive head of Dialdirect. “Theirs is a multi-million-rand industry where anything from a meticulously planned hijacking‚ to more opportunistic hits‚ are just another day at the office. South African vehicle owners have to take this very seriously and be thoroughly prepared.” According to Dialdirect’s crime statistics‚ the top five vehicle hijacking trends are: Tips to avoid becoming a victim: There are also eight golden rules to follow if you are confronted by a hijacker: • Remain calm • Do not argue • Do not make sudden gestures. • Use the hand closest to the safety belt clip to unbuckle if asked to leave the vehicle. • Avoid eye contact but try to remember what the carjacker looked like by identifying and remembering special features. • Comply with the hijacker’s directions (within reason) • Try and get away from the area as quickly as possible • Don’t be a hero – your life is worth more than your car “None of us can afford to think that ‘It won’t happen to me’. We have to be vigilant and thoroughly prepared for the worst‚” said Scott-Rodger.
