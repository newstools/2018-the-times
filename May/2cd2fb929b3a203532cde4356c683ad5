The Western Cape's local government MEC has welcomed an independent assessment showing municipalities in the province are the best in the country. Anton Bredell said the report by ratings agency Ratings Afrika reflected the results of a lot of hard work. “This is the latest of multiple independent agencies‚ including the auditor-general‚ saying the same thing‚” he said. “While we have many challenges and shortcomings‚ overall the best-run municipalities in South Africa are in the Western Cape.” Ratings Afrika evaluated operating performance‚ liability management‚ budget practices and the liquidity of each municipality in compiling its data. It found that of the eight major metros‚ only Cape Town and Tshwane had an operating profit (R3.36-billion and R730-million‚ respectively)‚ while the rest had a combined operating loss of R5.14-billion. Western Cape municipalities combined scored 62%‚ the highest among all the provinces. The average score for the entire country was 41%. Gauteng scored 30% and the Free State 19%. Mossel Bay and Swartland (Malmesbury) municipalities shared the top score. Bredell said no municipality in the Western Cape was under administration. “There is an ongoing intervention in Bitou [Plettenberg Bay] and George in terms of Section 106 of the Municipal Systems Act. Implementing section 106 does not mean a council is being placed under administration. “We try to avoid [administration] as far as we can. It is always the last resort when all other measures have failed. We do not want to see any council placed under administration because that could impact service delivery‚ but we will not hesitate to do so if it comes down to it. “We have shown in recent past with Oudtshoorn and Kannaland we will not hesitate to step in when we have to.”
