Khanyi Mbau and Tebogo Lerole have kept fans guessing where their relationship status is concerned. In January the celebrity couple shocked fans when they confirmed that they decided to call it quits. Khanyi penned an emotional statement on social media, breaking the unfortunate news to fans. "Today I made peace with a battle that I have lost. I have accepted defeat. My greatest fear and my greatest loss... letting go of the man I gave my heart too @edwardbillion. It has taken so much from me in convincing myself that I am okay? Today I chose to face my fears and accept my truth." Ever since then Khanyi and Tebogo have fueled the rumour mill that they have rekindled the flame, but neither of them have confirmed it.
