Two drops of blood on the bathroom floor. These are the only clue to suggest that something terrible may have happened to three-year-old Liyaqat “Lee” Mentoor, who went missing from a Roodepoort home two months ago to the day. And while Lee remains missing, for his 23-year-old mother Kaylah Mentoor and her family, only the faintest glimmer of hope remains that he will ever be found alive. “I can’t deal with it, I really can’t. I can’t even explain how I am feeling,” Kaylah said. “He’s my only baby. It’s hard – I try not to be emotional and cry. I haven’t cried in a long time but yesterday, yesterday was really hard,” she said. The day before had been Mother’s Day. The case against the man believed to have harmed Lee, Onke Mashinini (29), also rests on the blood found in Mashinini’s parental home.
