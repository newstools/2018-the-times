It's unclear what upset Johannesburg residents more on Monday - the severe traffic backlog heading to OR Tambo International airport or the loss of an expensive car. A crash before Barbara Road has resulted in a long queue near the OR Tambo International Airport‚ according to Traffic SA. Motorists are advised to use the N12 E or the R21 N via Jet Park to avoid delays. All lanes are at a standstill on the R24‚ according to road user Gerhard Engelbrecht. Roads near the Cradlestone Mall were also backed up on Monday morning when two trucks collided‚ leaving cans of cooldrink scattered all over. ER24 said eight people were injured in the multiple vehicle collision at the Hendrik Potgieter and R28 Road intersection‚ west of Johannesburg‚ at about 7am. Altogether‚ "it was found that two truck and three vehicles had collided and had come to a stop in the middle of the intersection." Several loads of softdrinks that had been on the back of one of the trucks were scattered around the scene. Paramedics found that approximately eight people had sustained moderate injuries. One of the patients was initially trapped inside a vehicle‚ and had to be freed by rescue services. The crash involving a Maserati - a luxury vehicle that can retail for R1.6-million - did not result in any injuries, but it was the one that got South Africans talking. Johannesburg roads were drenched on Monday as a cold snap hit the province. The worst of the cold was felt on Monday‚ according to a forecaster‚ although low temperatures are expected over the next 96 hours. Overnight temperatures are set to drop to fresh lows‚ but the rain is set to ease by late Tuesday.
