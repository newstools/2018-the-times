US president Donald Trump announced his decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal on May 8 2018. But what exactly is the Iran nuclear deal? And how does it affect South Africa? The deal could mean bad news for the global economy, particularly when it comes to the price of oil - as Iran is a major oil producer. Sanctions mean that they wouldn't supply that oil anymore, and if we decided to deal with Iran anyway we'd risk America placing sanctions on us. This means you could end up paying more at the pump, and the rand could suffer. As to the deal itself, the deal was designed to restrict Iran's nuclear activities. Those restrictions are policed by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The biggest obstacle to building a nuclear weapon is obtaining enough fissile material — highly enriched uranium or plutonium — for the core of the bomb. A central aim of the deal was to extend the time Iran would need to do that, if it chose to, to a year from about 2-3 months. The JCPOA, which took effect in January 2016, cuts off the plutonium track while severely restricting uranium enrichment. Iran was building a heavy-water reactor at Arak that could eventually have produced spent fuel from which plutonium could be separated. Under the JCPOA: Iran has two vast enrichment sites, at Natanz and Fordow. Much of Natanz is deep underground and Fordow is buried inside a mountain, which is widely believed to protect them from aerial bombardment. The deal allows Iran to continue enrichment at Natanz but with a series of constraints. It turns Fordow into a “nuclear, physics and technology centre” where centrifuges are used for purposes other than enrichment, like producing stable isotopes. The JCPOA: The text of the deal also:
