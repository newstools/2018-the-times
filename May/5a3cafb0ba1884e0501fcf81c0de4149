Parliament has discovered a scam that solicits money in the name of National Council of Provinces chair Thandi Modise. "Modise has seen various emails‚ sent from an email bearing her name‚ requesting the receiver to transfer large sums of money – about R80 000 – to an undisclosed account number. In the emails‚ the writer claims that Ms Modise cannot take calls but is only available on email and promises to return the 'loan' after a few days‚" Parliament said in a statement. "We urge members of the public‚ who receive such emails‚ currently sent from modiset091@gmail.com‚ not to respond to these fabricated requests. Parliament has referred the scam to relevant security authorities for investigation." The statement said a number of MPs and members of the public had received the email‚ adding that one of Modise's acquaintances had already fallen victim to the scam. "It is not the first time scams of this nature‚ involving Parliament's Presiding Officers‚ have occurred. This happened several times during the fourth democratic Parliament – asking‚ on fake Parliament letterheads‚ for money to be deposited into fake bank accounts in the name of then Speaker of the National Assembly Mr Max Sisulu‚" it said. "Anyone who has received such a letter or email is urged to come forward to assist with the investigation."
