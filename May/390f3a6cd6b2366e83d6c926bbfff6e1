Losing a cherished pet can be one of the saddest moments in your life but does that apply if your pet is a robot? In Japan, a memorial was held at a Buddhist temple for 114 "deceased" Aibo robotic dogs, the Guardian reported. The ceremony is performed similarly as it would for humans. Priests in traditional robes burned incense, chanted sutras and prayed for the souls of the robotic animals. One of the priests, Bungen Oi, says the robotic dogs should be treated the same way as living beings. “All things have a bit of soul,” he said.
