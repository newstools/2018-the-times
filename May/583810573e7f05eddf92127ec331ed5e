Save the Children South Africa estimated that the social and economic burden of violence against children was at R238.58-billion in 2015 alone. The organisation was briefing the portfolio committee on basic education on Tuesday on the results of its costing study on violence against children. It was also briefing the committee on key activities to be implemented to prevent such violence. Save the Children South Africa came to this figure by looking at a number of cost categories‚ including reduced earnings due to physical violence against children and emotional violence against children‚ and child welfare costs. In its presentation to the committee‚ the organisation’s CEO Gugu Ndebele said violence against children needed to be managed comprehensively. She suggested that children should be trained in identifying and reporting abuse. Ndebele added that parents and caregivers should be empowered on positive parenting and that there should be ban on corporal punishment at home. This includes preventing it from occurring by having effective and skilled professionals‚ good quality early childhood development and education for all stakeholders including parents.
