From now on you can call popular Ukhozi FM DJ Thembeka Zondo, Mrs Cele! The radio host tied the knot to her bae Bongani Cele last weekend in Port Shepstone, KwaZulu-Natal. The fancy affair was attended by family and close friends like Sthandwa Nzuza Gama, Mroza Buthelezi and Ayanda Ncwane. The couple first dazzled guests with a simple African outfit, before changing into traditional outfits for a ceremony. Thandeka and other guests led a dance in the street on the way to the ceremony, while horns and drums played. The couple then had a white wedding, with Thembeka wowing in a sleeveless gown. Finally, the moment had "arrived" and the couple shared a kiss while guests cheered on and stood to applaud them.
