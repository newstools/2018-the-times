After a five-year break from the spotlight, gospel artist Solly Moholo is making a comeback. The gospel singer, who has been in the industry for decades, has been known for his no-nonsense approach to current affairs and issues facing Mzansi. Despite taking a break from recording music, Solly has been watching Mzansi's political climate and what he calls the rise of false prophets, insisting that now is the perfect time to bounce back. During an interview with Move! magazine, Solly said that he will not stop singing about politics and issues affecting the country because people want to be engaged when they listen to gospel music. "People are eating grass like they are cows, while some are drinking petrol like they are cars," Solly said about false prophets. Solly will be releasing his new album called Palamente eKgopela Merapelo soon. In September 2016, Solly found himself making headlines for all the wrong reasons after social media was in a frenzy over a song called, Ke Batla Kuku ( I Want P***y). Apparently it was initially believed that Solly made the song after he was allegedly admitted to a mental institution. However, speaking to Daily Sun at the time, Solly slammed the claims. "I have nothing to do with this song, I would never record such music, I would never release a song that looks down on anyone.Â They are jealous and they are trying to tarnish my name," he told the paper at the time.
