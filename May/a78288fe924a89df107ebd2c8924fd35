Some go to Mecca‚ others go to the Vatican City. But for 52-year-old Arlene Prinsloo from Cape Town‚ her “pilgrimage” will take her to the royal wedding in Windsor‚ London. Prinsloo’s fascination with the royal family wasn’t an instant love affair but happened in three stages. At five years old she watched the 1971 film Mary‚ Queen of Scots‚ and was intrigued by the queen’s story. Later‚ her mom relayed a story of how thousands‚ including herself‚ lined the streets of Cape Town to welcome King George and Queen Elizabeth‚ who was 21 at the time. But it is only when Diana‚ Princess of Wales‚ entered the scene‚ that the fascination with the royals turned into a lifelong affair.
