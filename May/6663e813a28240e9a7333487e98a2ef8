SBV South Africa has distanced itself from photographs being shared on social media that purport to show a security guard with R1.5-million in cash linked to last week's cash in transit heist in Boksburg. "We're aware of a tweet that implicates a SBV employee in a recent heist. Authorities have confirmed that THIS IS NOT a SBV employee. Investigations are still under way‚" the company said in a statement. Police are being contacted for comment. SBV reiterated that it is committed to working with authorities to apprehend criminals involved in cash in transit robberies. SBV shared its concern at the spike in CIT attacks‚ saying there had been 135 of these robberies in 2018 thus far‚ as calculated to the end of last week. "We're on day 140 of 2018 - that's one cash in transit incident for nearly every day this year‚" the company said. It is appealing to people to report these robbers to the authorities‚ and is offering cash rewards.
