When Siya Kolisi becomes the first black Springbok Test captain against England next month he will end more than a century of white players captaining the national team. The Boks play against Wales in Washington on June 2 and provincial teammate Pieter-Steph du Toit has been asked to lead the team that day. Kolisi and 16 other players from the 43-man squad chosen for June’s Tests will stay behind to prepare for England. At Ellis Park on June 9 when Kolisi leads the team he will be playing in his 29th Test and will become Bok captain No 61. Du Toit is Bok captain No 60. Kolisi though is not the first black player to captain the Springboks – hooker Chiliboy Ralepelle led the Boks against a World XV in a non-Test in 2006. Read the full story on Times Select.
