On last night's episode ofÂ  Yobe a convicted rapist asked the show to help him ask for forgiveness from his victim, only to find out from the family that she died after being depressed from the rape ordeal. People on Twitter expressed outrage over rapists asking for forgiveness on the reality show and filled the platform with angry comments. According to the convict, the victim was raped by a group of guys she asked to walk her home. She knew them and they knew her and the guy that was asking for forgiveness from her mother said, he watched them rape her, but instead of helping her, he got aroused and also had sex with her. Twitter expressed their outrage and called for rapists to be excluded from the reality show because there was no excuse for rape.
