Thembi Seete has avoided any questions around her pregnancy, insisting that in her culture, it is private, and she won't be sharing much with the media.

However, as she celebrated her first Mother's Day on Sunday, Thembi revealed that baby has arrived. "When anything comes at the right time, God ensures we are ready and PRESENT. I had to be present enough to live in every moment with you. From carrying you for 9 months to giving birth and watching you grow into your own person & learning who God has created you to be on a daily basis," she wrote on her Instagram account. Thembi said she is grateful for God's timing and his trust in her to take care of his masterpiece.
