A police officer pulled a gun on a California man for pocketing a pack of Mentos mints - after the man had paid for them. In CCTV footage captured at the Buena Park petrol station in April, Joe Arreola can be seen handing money to the cashier for a roll of Mentos mints. While waiting for his change, he pocketed the mints. That's when the man behind him pulled a gun from his pocket and announced he was a police officer. Arreola, 49, tried to explain to the officer that he had paid for the Mentos, but the off-duty cop insists he put it back on the counter and leave the store. After a few tense moments, the cashier can be heard telling the officer that Arreola had in fact paid. The officer apologises for his mistake. Arreola told the Orange County Register that he was still shaken by the incident. "It was traumatic, the whole incident. (And) I grew up in Santa Ana. I’ve been shot at before." Buena Park Police Chief Corey Sianez said he found the video to be 'disturbing'. "I can definitely assure you that our investigation will be thorough and if the officer is found to be in violation of any policies and procedures, he will be held accountable," he said in a statement released on Facebook.
