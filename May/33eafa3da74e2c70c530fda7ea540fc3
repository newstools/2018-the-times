Former ANC MP Makhosi Khoza has been appointed as head of local government programmes at the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa). Outa CEO welcomed Khoza to the organisation‚ which has campaigned against corruption and the introduction of e-tolls. Khoza rose to prominence as one of the MPs who formed part of a parliamentary inquiry into the SABC. She later became one of the few ANC MPs to publicly criticise former president Jacob Zuma and in November last year resigned from the ruling party. Khoza said she had been subjected to death threats. Khoza recently resigned from her newly formed named African Democratic Change‚ saying that she was ready to leave politics.
