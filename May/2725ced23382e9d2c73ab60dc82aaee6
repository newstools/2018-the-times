The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has opened a missing person’s case after the disappearance of one of its members. According to the union‚ Jan Mokoena was last seen on April 25 during the national protest against the new labour laws and has not been seen since. “Jan Mokoena is one of our most active members. He has been working for more than 10 years at a bricks manufacturing company called Nystene near Modimolle‚ formerly known as Nylstroom in Polokwane. Jan is currently staying with his ailing mother and his younger sister in a village called Mamatlala in Mokopane. His family is deeply distressed about his disappearance‚” the union said in a statement. “Local officials have been going on blitzes moving from parks‚ mortuaries and all other public places in an attempt to find him. They will also be organising another search party for him this weekend.” The union has urged anyone with information on his whereabouts to contact the police or their local office.
