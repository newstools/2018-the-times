Final preparations are underway for the Twitter memorial service in honour of "fallen comrade" Shamba the lion, with Twitter drawing up a programme for the service that includes Pearl Thusi, Julius Malema, Cassper Nyovest and Mzwakhe Mbuli. Shamba died after mauling the owner of a private game reserve in Limpopo over the weekend. Although the owner of the Marakele Animal Sanctuary, Mike Hodge, sustained injuries to his neck and jaw and is currently recovering in hospital after the attack, it was the lion's death that dominated chatter on the Twitter streets this week. As the news broke of Shamba's death, devastated mourners fueled their pain behind the the hashtag #RipShamba. But, no, that wasn't enough. The masses then organised a mock memorial service with people chipping in to make suggestions of who should address the nation at the service. The highlights obviously include: But there was also requests for Msholozi and DJ Tira to be there...oh and that Rasta who always paints at the memorials. And it looks like the tombstone is sorted too!
