Police officers tracking a gang of cash-in-transit robbers have killed a Pretoria homeowner and apparently critically injured his family after they apparently stormed the wrong house. TimesLIVE understands that two joggers were also shot and injured in the exchange of gunfire‚ and that three suspects had been arrested. According to sources‚ the officers mistook the slain man’s house for the suspects’ hideout. There are multiple houses on the same property. A police officer‚ who lives across the road from the house in Kilner Park‚ was injured when he ran to assist his neighbour‚ police sources said. “It's f***ed up. The suspects who were in their cars were seen in the street. When they saw the cops they fled in their vehicles. “Police stormed the house they thought was the safehouse‚ but its apparently the wrong house. For some reason one of the cops opened fire and then the others did. It’s a total mess‚” said a police source. Another officer said several people were rushed to hospital. “Its too early to say their conditions‚” he said‚ declining to say if women and children were among the injured. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi three people were arrested and two people were injured in the operation, which was still ongoing. He added that the owner of the property was being questioned and nothing had been recovered from the scene.
