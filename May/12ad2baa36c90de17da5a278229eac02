Advocacy group the Free Market Foundation believes government’s new proposed tobacco bill is racist and anti-transformative. The cabinet announced last month that it had approved the Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill‚ the government’s first significant reforms to tobacco control legislation in a decade. If the bill is passed in parliament it will bring a ban to all public smoking‚ including already designated areas found in restaurants and outdoor smoking. Other proposals in the bill are prohibiting the sale of cigarettes in vending machines‚ banning displays of cigarettes by retailers and bringing e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery devices into the regulatory fold for the first time.
