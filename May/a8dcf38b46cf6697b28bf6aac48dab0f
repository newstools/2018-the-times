American entertainment site, TMZ, is reporting that musician Avicii took his own life in Muscant, Oman. The site claims sources close to the situation have detailed how Avicii apparently used glass to cut himself. "Our sources say the method of death was a shard of glass that caused massive bleeding. Two sources tell us Avicii broke a bottle and used the glass to inflict the fatal wound. One of the sources says it was a wine bottle," wrote TMZ. In a statement released by his family, they alluded to suicide as being the cause of death. “Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who traveled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress,” the statement reads. “When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be happy and be able to do what he loved most – music. He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace.” The 28-year-old was found dead on 20 April inside his hotel room. Police ruled out any foul play.
