Sit down and grab your popcorn, Bonnie Mbuli has some things to get off her chest. The Afternoon Express presenter took to the Twitter pulpit recently to talk about the role of black women in society and claimed their value is often attached to the value they give men. "We are shamed for not having children,called used goods when we have had children. Society, especially men have relegated a woman’s worth to the servicing of their consumption whims. Woman, do you, on your terms, for your own fulfillment. "When men are absent they are still requiring women to spend their strength in service to their responsibility and lack of accountability. Let us teach our girl children the value of their agency, it must enter into their minds from an early age that marriage is something you choose, having children is something you choose,it is not your duty, and does not validate your existence as a woman." She said because the environment was so "hostile towards women", and they need to forge their own path. "Black women are sowing new seeds and laying new foundations to build the kind of communities that allow them to thrive, we are leaving those oppressive, stifling roots that have strangled our power for far too long." "We were the only ones uniting with you, you were not uniting with us, you were for yourselves and now we see and recognize it, you murder us in our homes and kick us like footballs in the streets, our mission is not to hurt you back, it is to finally choose ourselves."
