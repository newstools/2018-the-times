"This is our land, we must die for it." Those were the words of EFF leader Julius Malema as he addressed hundreds of supporters at an Africa Day celebration at Jubilee Park in Sunnyside, Pretoria, on Friday. "My children are going to inherit a dignified life. I'm going to start now, I'm going to fight for my children," he added. Malema told his party's supporters that the EFF was going to "give you the land, with or without the ANC or the DA - we don't need them." On Wednesday, Malema was asked to leave Parliament for calling on landless people to occupy unoccupied land without permission. The EFF has repeatedly said it wants land expropriation without compensation to be implemented across South Africa.
