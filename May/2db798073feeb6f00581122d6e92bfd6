It's not that we been sleeping on Proverb's progress in the 'Boyfriend Olympics' but it wasn't until Twitter decided to remove Maps Maponyane as CEO of the NAHAB (National Association of Husbands and Boyfriends) in the boyfriend division, that we saw how suited Pro was for the position. Maps was removed by Twitter right after reports emerged that he and buddy (also his long-suspected girlfriend, although they never officially confirmed their relationship)  had ended their buddyship amidst claims that Maps cheated. Twitter didn't waste time on the new appointment... We can't disagree with the decision because Proverb has truly been winning in the marathon of love. Since Pro and his gorgeous girlfriend "came out" as a couple, theirs has been a beautiful journey to watch. To be honest, they are one of the cutest couples in Mzansi entertainment. In addition to the numerous kind gestures they do for each other, they also take random baecations and just look so happy in all their selfies and photoshoots. Speaking to TshisaLIVE earlier this year after she cracked her rib during a dancing competition, Liesl mentioned how supportive Pro was. "Sometimes he's shooting far from Joburg, like on location, and if there's no flight back he'll  rather drive back than miss the show. That is just the kind of guy he is. It's really a blessing to have him in my life. When there are people in the crowd cheering, he's always one of them." Perhaps we are all really too invested in celebrity couples. Pshhh we can't help it. While both and Pro and Liesl are not perfect, they look fully capable of successfully doing this relationship thing. Plus with Pro's WINNING boyfriend skills, he looks like he'll do a good job as CEO. We wish him nothing but the best.
