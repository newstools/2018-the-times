Just when you thought all the excitement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Big Day was over, Kensington Palace has released three of the love-up couple's official wedding photos on social media — and they are stunning! Taken in the lavishly-decorated Green Drawing Room of Windsor Castle, the first family portrait has a more formal feel. The newlyweds are flanked by the Queen, Prince Phillip, and the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall on one side, and the bride's mother, Doria Ragland, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the other. The shot also features the couple's pageboys and bridesmaids, including Princess Charlotte, who is perched prettily on her mom's lap, and a smiling Prince George. The newlywed's entourage of pint-sized attendants feature more prominently in the second shot, which has a more relaxed and casual feel. The grinning groom kneels behind his radiant bride, who is seated on the floor with the train of her dress and her veil spread out in front of her. The last is a striking black-and-white portrait of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, posed on a set of stairs outdoors. The couple's smiles are as bright as Markle's diamond tiara; it looks as if the pair are having a good chuckle. The setting brings to mind one of the snaps from their engagement shoot, which was shot by the same photographer, Alexi Lubomirski. Says Lubomirski on Instagram: "It has been an incredible honor and privilege to document the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's inspiring journey of love, hope and family ... This has been a beautiful chapter in my career and life, that I will happily never forget."
