"In his 35 years of revolutionary activism in the ANC‚ he has mastered the art of remaining simple and humble at all times‚ despite sustained concocted attacks against him by some friends and comrades‚" said Dantjie. Dantjie said Mahumapelo will continue to serve the ANC in whatever new role the party decided for him. "We urge him to remain steadfast in what he believes are the necessary tasks of executing the revolution‚" Dantjie said.
