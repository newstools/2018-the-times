Winter has come early for the Tiffindell Ski and Alpine resort much to the surprise – and delight – of staff. The Eastern Cape resort‚ in the Southern Drakensberg‚ experienced its first natural snowfall of the year this weekend and by Monday morning it was snowing again. “This is a sign of winter arriving early. “The video was taken [about 10am] and it's still snowing now [about 12pm] so we don't know how deep the snow is‚” the resort’s Tayla Whitehead said. “We make our own snow as well‚ but we need it to be a certain temperature and for snow-making you need a certain humidity so this is very exciting for us.” Whitehead said the snow had come a bit earlier than normal this year‚ starting with a “light dusting of snow [that] covered the mountain of Ben Macdhui‚ on Saturday night”. “When the month of May has a snowfall‚ we predict a winter skiing season of June‚ July and August with regular snowfalls throughout‚” Whitehead said. – HeraldLIVE
