Former Generations star Sthandiwe Kgoroge had to endure a whole lot of hardships trying to navigate this life thing with "dark skin."  Now wants to document the experiences of those who have also been teased for their complexion. The star, who shot to fame for her role as twins Zinzi and Zoleka Mudau on the popular soapie, took to social media this week to open up about her battle with finding beauty in her skin. "Everything negative was attached to my dark skin, everything unattractive. Until the day I looked around and realized that my dark complexion is pulchritude personified and that I love my dark complexion!" She said it only mattered how she saw herself. "I decided that it’s not my problem that people don’t see 'me', and that what matters is how I see myself. This is the only skin I have and I am comfortable with its magic! So I chose to hear and respond to 'hey, dark beauty. Dark Dindi, ndoni ya manzi” The actress is directing a stage production in August and asked women to send their "skin journey" to her so that she can include it in the production. One of the first women to respond was Langa Ngoma, sister of Nandi Madida, who shared how her sister and mother inspired her. "My mother always taught us that black is beautiful. My sister Nandi also always encouraged me to love my skin. I am so grateful for the women in my life who taught me to love my dark complexion," she wrote.
