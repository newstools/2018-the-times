If you ever doubted thatÂ Siyasanga Kobese and Akhumzi Jezile were friendship goals for days, then cava here. The pair were tighter than a bottle of tomato sauce you're trying to open when your hands are wet, and even shot a hilarious video of themselves clowning around. The video, first shot several months ago by the pair, spread like wildfire after news of their death was confirmed a week ago. They were travelling in a car with actor Thobani Mseleni and two other people when they were involved in a head-on collision that killed everyone in the vehicle. Tributes continue to pour in for those killed in the accident, with social media flooded with messages and shared memories.
