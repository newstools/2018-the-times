Emtee's son Avery celebrated his birthday recently. And, proud papa wanted Avery to have a cool set of wheels so bought him a mini Mercedes-Benze A Class. This little boy's whip looks better than ours, which is falling apart. Emtee's little man also enjoyed his birthday party surrounded by loved ones.
