A Richards Bay businessman‚ who was driving to Umhlanga on Friday with cash to buy a new car‚ was shot during a high-speed chase by armed robbers. With the robbers on his tail‚ the man sped to the nearest hospital for refuge and treatment. Police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said the unnamed man was chased from the M41 interchange‚ which leads to the plush seaside village near Durban‚ by people in a white BMW. "He was carrying cash because he was on his way to buy a car. During their pursuit the suspects opened fire on the man‚” said Gwala. "The suspects arrived [at the hospital] shortly after the victim and took the cash from the car. They were armed with pistols and rifles." Police are investigating. Hospital management didn't immediately respond to queries.
