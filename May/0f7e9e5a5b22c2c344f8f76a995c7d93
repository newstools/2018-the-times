While the rest of us have been piling on the layers to deal with the icy weather, Melanie Bala has been soaking up the vitamin D in Bali. Mel jetted off for some fun in the sun with one of her friends. Apart from taking time away from the stresses of everyday life, this trip means a lot to Mel, who said she has had a "difficult" two years. "Two years ago I planned to take a trip to Thailand for my birthday. The day before I was meant to leave, my father passed away. I was completely devastated. Itâ€™s been a very difficult two years. Today, I spent my birthday at the Tirtha Empul Tampaksiring - a Hindu Balinese Water Temple." Mel said she made a simple offering and asked for "guidance, clarity, strength, protection, peace, love and joy for today, and always." It's also been six months since Mel and Zwai announced their split after 10 years of marriage. "We were together for 17 years and who you are when you meet at 20-something is a lot different to who you are when you are 40-something. You grow. You change. You evolve," she said about their split during a CliffCentral interview. And, judging by the pictures, she has been having the time of her life.
