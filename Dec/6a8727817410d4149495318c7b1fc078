Billionaire Johann Rupert ruffled feathers and outraged many following his comments at the annual PowerFM Chairman's Conversation in Johannesburg on Tuesday night.Hosted by the chairman of MSG Afrika, Given Mkhari, this year's event featured Rupert, whose comments about the state of the country had many on Twitter infuriated. Rupert made comments on the economic standing of black youth, claiming that they never save and spend their money at Taboo, a popular Joburg club, and on BMWs.The businessman also claimed that "there are no leaders in your generation," saying that Steve Biko would never have been found in a nightclub.After an evening of racial and tribal stereotypes, when accused of making racial remarks Rupert said: "People of my age group know I'm not a racist."There were key moments where the businessman had to be corrected on his use of terminology, such as referring to black people as "blacks" and using terms such as "the snowflake generation".Rupert also took several jabs at the EFF, referring to them as the "red-beret Vendas" and "comrades who buy their struggle uniform at Pepkor". At some point after asking Rupert a question, Gauteng MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi staged a walk-out. Twitter was not impressed and called the interview a hot mess.
