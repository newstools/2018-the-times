The Nedbank Cup last 32 stage draw served up some intriguing match-ups after the tournament was launched in Sandton on Thursday night.

Last year's finalist Maritzburg are away at fellow NFD side Witbank Spurs.

"The Nedbank Cup has been a practical vehicle for those dreams to come through. We have seen this with many clubs including Baroka FC who first made a name for themselves in this competition. "Now they are a household name. We have more appetite of these stories because we truly believe in the power of football to change lives. "Together with Nedbank‚ we look forward to what 2019 has in store for us. May all the clubs and players‚ mainly from those amateur structures‚ grab this opportunity and make use of it‚” she added. The last 32 fixtures will be played from January 23-29‚ with the PSL to announce exact dates‚ venues and kick-off times in due course.
