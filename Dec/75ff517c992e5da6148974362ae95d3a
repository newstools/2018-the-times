Just because you caught your dinner, doesn't mean you get to keep it. A lioness's hard work to capture a warthog came undone when a cackle of ravenous hyena descended upon her. At first the lioness tries to ignore the bleating hyenas but quickly realises this is a fight she won't win as she backs off, leaving her kill to the scavengers. This video was filmed in the Serengeti in Tanzania by Kitty from Africa Odyssey.
