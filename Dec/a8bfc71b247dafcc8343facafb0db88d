Actress and activist Ayanda Borotho has questioned societies beliefs in purity, claiming that signs of purity are oppressive tools used by a patriarchal society that needs to change. The Isibaya star has never been shy to share her opinion and life lessons with her followers on social media. This week she took aim at virginity and the wedding veil, claiming they were unfair symbols of oppression. "'Virginity didn't save us'. Have you ever asked yourself why we fuss about the wedding veil? Especially in religious settings. The veil presents the bride as holy and untouched - preserved for her husband, presented by her father. "These subtle but profound oppressive narratives are everywhere. We must remove our own veil that hinders us from seeing patriarchy for what it is. Often hidden as "purity", yet we are not held to the same standards." She said that men were not held to the same standard of purity and asked why society wouldn't let womenÂ "live without narratives of virginity, purity, and whatever else". "What makes men pure? It's certainly not virginity. It's all the same, virgin or not, women are still marginalised, oppressed and abused. (They are) treated as commodities or trophies. With price tags on every part of our body." She moved quickly to clarify that she is not pushing for woman to be "loose". "I don't advocate for promiscuity. I advocate for equality. Hold us to equal standards. Women make this mistake all the time. Don't give him all of you when you have what's left over of him."
