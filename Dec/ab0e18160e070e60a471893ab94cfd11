Lawyer, model and activist Thando Hopa was recently named as one of the top 100 most influential women across the world, but the rise to the top has not been an easy journey. Thando is one of many people living with albinism and knows first hand what it feels like to face stereotypes and to be discriminated against because of her skin. During an interview with Top Women Thando got candid about some of the things she's had to deal with. "It was the contradictory beliefs that people with albinism bring either good or bad luck. Having people hug and hold me for good luck, or conversely spit into the necklines of their tops to ward off bad luck or make a big show of not wanting to touch me for fear of becoming like me or having children who are like me. I felt like a walking commodity, struggling to find words to explain how ordinary I am." Thando added that all her life people have used "dehumanising words" when they spoke about her. The model who has been flying the SA flag high globally said that even though stereotypes about albinism was still rife, at least there were now conversations around the condition which was a small victory. Here's a recent interview Thando did with eNCA where she also spoke about the prejudice she's faced.
