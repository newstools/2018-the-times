The SA Revenue Service (Sars) on Wednesday said it had seized products used to manufacture mandrax and sex enhancement drugs worth almost R100m at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg in the past few days. Sars said two consignments of acetonitrile – a substance used in the manufacture of mandrax - were found. The first consignment weighed 1,600kg while the second weighed 1,581kg. "The police's forensic laboratory confirmed the substance with an estimated street value of R90m," said spokesperson Sicelo Mkosi. Both consignments were being brought into South Africa from the same country, but Mkosi would not disclose which. He would also not say whether those linked to the drugs were foreign nationals. Meanwhile, sexual enhancement drugs were also seized at the airport. These were valued at over R24m. "The goods were handed over to port health officials for further investigation," said Mkosi. These were again being brought into South Africa from a foreign country. Mkosi said all three cases had been handed over to the police.
