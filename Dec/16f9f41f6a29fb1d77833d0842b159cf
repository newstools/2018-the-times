Motorists need eyes in the back of their heads, literally, with two rear-end accidents reported on Friday - the start of the festive season traffic rush. Johannesburg paramedics from Emer-G-Med's Braamfontein, Victoria and Empire teams were called out after a tyre came off a Rea Vaya bus down a steep hill, into the back of a vehicle. Two patients were transported to the Hillbrow clinic, the emergency service said. In the second incident,Â a "truck allegedly rear-ended a vehicle, causing it to roll". The accident happened on the N4 Rustenburg highway about 1.5km from the Dr Swanepoel offramp, in a westerly direction. One patient was transported to a medical facility, Emer-G-Med said.
