Police on Friday arrested a 54-year-old man accused of shooting a dog in a quiet cul-de-sac west of Durban. Officers also discovered various weapons in the man's house. "Hillcrest police have arrested a 54-year-old suspect after he handed himself over to the police. Further police investigation led to the confiscation of three rifles, a pistol and 47 rounds of ammunition. He was charged and released on R2,000 bail," said KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Col Thembeka Mbele. Outrage erupted after the man apparently shot the dog four times on Tuesday evening. It was not immediately clear why he had killed the animal. Mbele said investigations were continuing.
