Former Bafana Bafana striker Shaun Bartlett has been appointed as Kaizer Chiefs assistant coach with immediate effect. Bartlett joins Chiefs on a two-and-a-half year deal and will assist recently-appointed coach Ernst Middendorpâ€š who himself joined the club a few days ago on a similar contract length. Chiefs sacked Italian Giovanni Solinas on Friday and will play their first game under the new coaching duo when they face Supersport United on Wednesday night.
