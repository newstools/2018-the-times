Luthuli House has muzzled Jacob Zuma’s supporters from speaking at the former president’s court appearances. Known critics of President Cyril Ramaphosa, among them former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo and Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama, were barred from addressing Zuma supporters outside the high court in Pietermaritzburg on Friday on the instructions of Luthuli House. The decision is believed to be linked to panic among provincial party leaders who have aligned themselves with Ramaphosa and who fear that the ANC’s January 8 rally at Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban could be used to embarrass the president. Party insiders said the KwaZulu-Natal provincial leadership, especially chair Sihle Zikalala, fear the rally will expose divisions in the ANC ahead of the elections, and assert Zuma’s popularity at the expense of Ramaphosa.
