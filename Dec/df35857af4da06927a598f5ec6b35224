Muso Ami, formerly Amanda Faku, may belt out love songs but she isn’t about to sing confessions about her bae. After winning over fans during her stint on TV music reality show The Voice SA, Ami released her debut solo single Ndikhethe Wena in August. She told TshisaLIVE the song was about loving fully and not holding back. "People in relationships often have trust issues or something else weighing down the relationship, but it is okay to be vulnerable and love fully. It is important to understand that a person chose you out of everyone and you should never forget or take that for granted." While she admits that the song is based on personal experience, she is no rush to spill the tea on her love life. “I am in love. We have been together for ages. The way that I am in love is to not hold back. I won’t listen to what society thinks or what they dictate I should do. I am embracing it fully but also know how special it is. I want to guard it.” She said this included not really posting about her partner on social media or letting people into her private space. “As soon as you post about your partner, people will find the need to mock you. Sometimes it is about the person’s past, as if their past matters now. People are also quick to try find bad things about the person. So, people end up not posting about their partner to try avoid drama.” Ami said that her partner helped her through the hard times, including after her elimination on The Voice SA.
