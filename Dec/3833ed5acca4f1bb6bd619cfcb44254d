Authorities in Cape Town have criticised a private security company that allegedly ordered black beachgoers to leave Clifton Fourth Beach over the Christmas holiday. In a statement on Thursday, a senior local official dismissed claims by the Professional Protection Alternatives (PPA) security firm that it was working for the city authorities when patrolling the Clifton beach. Beachgoers were told to leave Clifton beach by PPA guards last Sunday, two days before Christmas. "The city has at no stage given any authority to PPA to enforce by-laws," Cape Town's director for safety and security Richard Bosman said in a statement. "The city has acted swiftly to address the conduct of PPA staff ... Any person who feels that they have been threatened or intimated by PPA staff can lay a charge with the SA Police Service." Local activist Chumani Maxwele alleged that the guards had targeted black people on the beach, which attracts huge crowds over the holiday season. "These private security guards are hired by the Clifton (residents), they are actually briefed to not allow black people who appear to look like they are from the townships or criminals onto the beach," he told the News 24 website. PPA CEO Alwyn Landman said that the company's guards did not close the beach, but acted to protect local residents after alleged criminal activity caused "mayhem".
