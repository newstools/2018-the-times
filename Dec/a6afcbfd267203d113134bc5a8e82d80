He may have filled the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban over the weekend but it was a bittersweet moment for rapper Cassper Nyovest, who has revealed how he had lost millions on potential sponsorships and broken promises. The Tito Mboweni hitmaker filled the stadium after doing the same at the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg, Orlando Stadium and FNB Stadium in previous years. The show, which saw Cassper arrive suspended in the air, cost millions in production and marketing. The muso has in the past spoken about his struggle to get sponsors on board, despite running the #FillUP series for four consecutive years. In the hours leading up to the show Cassper opened his heart to fans and told them how the show had nearly been canned five times because of fights to get support for it. "Wish I could tell you half the things we go through trying to put together a show like this. The saddest thing for me is that I’m having to fight against black people who have the power to either help me do this show or make sure it doesn’t happen. All I have is the fans really. "This show was almost stopped five times and we kept on pushing and persevering! Even right now, as we speak, I’m dealing with a very hectic issue that is a make or break. I need your prayers," he wrote on social media. Taking to Twitter after the concert on Saturday night, Cassper opened up about the losses he had to take in order to make his dream of filling Moses Mabhida Stadium a reality. "Bitter sweet morning. Knowing that we lost millions due to the lack of sponsorship and broken promises breaks my heart. But knowing that 100,000s of people are inspired makes my life. Would I do it again? Hell yeah! It’ll take me awhile to make the money back but the feeling is priceless!"
