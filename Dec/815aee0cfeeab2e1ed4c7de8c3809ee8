Three men who allegedly robbed an employee at a farm outside Tzaneen before making their getaway in a bakkie belonging to the farmer have been arrested in Phalaborwa, Limpopo. Among them was a man who escaped from custody with four others in Polokwane in November 2018, while being transported by police to court. The Citizen reported that a manhunt was under way for the last remaining escapee. The others were rearrested. Police spokesperson Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said at 6am on December 30 2018 a farm employee in the Letsitele area near Tzaneen was accosted in his room by two men. He was tied up with ropes and assaulted. The robbers took his belongings, including a mattress, a shotgun, two television sets, groceries and liquor. They loaded the goods into a bakkie belonging to the farm owner and left. Police were notified and a manhunt ensued. The stolen vehicle was spotted at Namakgale in Phalaborwa, about 70km from the crime scene. It sped off, but the driver lost control and hit a boundary wall in the street. The suspects were all apprehended and the stolen goods, including the wrecked bakkie, were recovered. Ngoepe said the rearrested suspect was connected to a murder case in the Ritavi area outside Tzaneen. He said the suspects would appear at the Namakgale and Nkowankowa magistrate’s courts soon.
