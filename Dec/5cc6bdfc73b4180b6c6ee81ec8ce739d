Christmas Day is traditionally spent with family over lunch but finance minister Tito Mboweni instead took a trip to downtown Johannesburg. Mboweni on Thursday bemoaned the state of downtown Johannesburg’s streets, describing them as filthy and embarrassing. He compared the streets to those in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, which he said were “clean and beautiful”.
