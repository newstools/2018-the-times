Almost three months after Skolopad's daughter got her driver's licence, the star surprised the teen with a Kia Picanto worth a little over R100,000 for passing grade 11. Skolopad told TshisaLIVE that her family, particularly her daughter had gone through a lot this year and she felt Amzozo, as she calls her, deserved a great gift. "It's been such a tough year for us but for my daughter particularly. She did well at school despite everything and that's why I felt she deserved something. Losing her dad and almost losing me, among other things. I didn't think she would do well at school and I would have understood but she surprised me." Although she wasn't willing to go into details Skolopad revealed that her daughter had lost her biological father and that both she andÂ Amzozo also almost died this year. She said when she thought of all the hardships they endured this year and of every blessing they still have, she felt proud of her daughter's strength. Amzozo told TshisaLIVE she was thankful that God had protected them the whole year and that her mom was blessed enough to buy her a car. Amzozo said she understood that she was lucky and promised to work hard to make her mom proud. "God is great. I am so happy and grateful for everything that he does for my family and that he made a way for my mother to do this for me. It's an overwhelming feeling of joy that I have every time I look at the car and I will make my mother proud at school next year." Check out the pictures below. Look at her go! That smile on her face is truly priceless.
