The funeral of an alleged house robber in Montclair, Durban, on Saturday was punctuated by car crashes and gunshots. The alleged robber was shot dead by a security guard on Durban's Bluff last week. The video starts with a car screeching before smashing into another car. Gunshots are then heard in the background. The video ends with a car narrowly missing people on the side of the road as it speeds towards them before spinning around.
