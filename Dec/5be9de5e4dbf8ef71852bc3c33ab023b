Beyoncé finally gave a new meaning to Bonang Matheba's "give the people what they want" phrase when she took to her 121-million followers on Instagram to give a well deserved shoutout to South Africa. We won't even front: it's about time Beyoncé acknowledged South Africa -  especially after everything Mzansi went through to come through for her. And yes, we were equally touched (along with the majority of the masses) that Beyoncé didn't post anything about her time in the "motherland". But when mo'ghel came through, she came all the way through, with a touching message and acknowledgement that African talent was EVERYTHING. And when we snapped out of our initial "we've just been recognised" stance, we all realised that the song attached to her #Throwback video was Mzansi's very own DJ Maphorisa with DJ Raybel featuring Moonchild Sanelly, K.O and Zulu Makhathini's iWalk Ye Phara. Watch the video below. Beyoncé also took time out to thank all the African designers that took their time to ensure that she looked like the super star she is. Just a few hours after the shoutout from Bey, Maphorisa topped the trends list on Twitter and tweeps went into celebration mode. Look, the man in truly international now. We know he produced Drake's song and all the other big moments, but this is Beyoncé, you need to recognise!
