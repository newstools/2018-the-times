Ordinarily we purchase the same items from different supermarkets for our taste tests. For this one, however, Checkers, Pick n Pay and Woolworths each shared four products from their wide festive ranges. As we were not comparing like with like, each item was rated individually and given a score out of 10. The judging panel for this blind tasting included a group of meat-lovers, including some esteemed chefs. All the products were cooked to package instructions and served as is, except for the unglazed hams that were scored and glazed with apricot jam. The preparation of the food was done by the chefs of the HTA School of Culinary Art in Randburg, Johannesburg, under the guidance of head chef Kabelo Segone. The meats were numbered and presented to the judges whole, without any packaging or reference to which store they came from, then sliced and served on platters.
