The use of live bullets by the military to quell Zimbabwe's post-election violence in August was "disproportionate and unjustified" President Emmerson Mnangagwa said on Tuesday, reading from a report presented by a team investigating the clashes. The violence erupted after Mnangagwa was declared the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe's removal from power, left six people dead and dozens injured. - Reuters
