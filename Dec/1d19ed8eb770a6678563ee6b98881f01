It took actor Lerato Makhetha a little longer than most people to get his "big break" in the industry and he's determined to not sleep on the opportunity and cement his name in the industry. Lerato, who is the son of veteran actor Jerry Mofokeng, scored a deal to be the new face of Ntando Sibeko on Isidingo, earlier this year and the 31-year-old star told TshisaLIVE that it was the result of years of sacrifice and dedication. "I know that it might sound cheesy because of my dad but I genuinely always wanted to be an actor. It is in my blood. I felt like it was something that I had to do. I think it was what pushed me, what drove me, when I was working outside the industry and taking odd jobs to just get enough cash to launch another attempt in the industry." He said that while people often couldn't believe his age when he told them he was 31, he was grateful he got a break when he was older than most people. "It can be strange if you allow it to be but we're in an industry where people get their breaks at different times. I'm glad it happened like this though. I think I was prepared for it more. I understood what the industry was like and I've been able to think about things a bit more, be more calculated in my decisions, than I think I would have been if I was younger.Â  I am not shading younger artists, I am just glad it happened for me like this." Lerato was able to count on the support of his family and friends during the hard times but said it was his own belief that kept him going. "With every rejection I would sit down and look at how I could do better. I would try work on it until the next audition and keep telling myself that this is my dream and my dream is valid. That if I just kept at it, eventually the door will open a little more and more. I wanted to make it on my own. I didn't want to be seen as Jerry Mofokeng's son in auditions so I would stress my own individuality. I wanted it to be my success story. That's what made it sweeter."
