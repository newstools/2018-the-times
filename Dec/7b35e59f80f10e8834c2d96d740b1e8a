Two days after the historic Global Citizen Festival at FNB Stadium, CCTV footage has emerged that shows the extent of the hours-long crime spree at a Sasol garage opposite the venue. TimesLIVE is in possession of several clips which show hundreds of people fleeing for safety at the Sasol Ormonde garage. The crime spree lasted more than five hours. Dozens of people have come forward to detail their experiences after the festival, explaining how they were mugged at gunpoint, heard shots being fired and were attacked at the garage. Police have consistently said they had a strong presence at the venue. In a statement to TimesLIVE, national police spokesperson Vish Naidoo said police did not leave their posts until hours after the show ended. Witnesses and the CEO of Stadium Management have disputed this, claiming that no police officers were visible after the last performance. In the footage obtained by TimesLIVE outside the Sasol garage, a single police van enters the vicinity two hours after violence first erupted. Seven people have since been arrested. Police have also appealed to people to report what happened.
