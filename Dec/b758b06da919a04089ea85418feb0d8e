There is some reprieve for frustrated South Africans as Eskom said there would be no scheduled power cuts - known as load-shedding - this Sunday. “We have recovered sufficient pumped storage levels and some of our generating units have returned to service.” But, despite this, the power utility said rotational power cuts remained a possibility as the power system was "in a state of ALERT". Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said: “The system operator has warned though, that the power system remains vulnerable and that the current status might be reviewed should the grid become constrained due to plant breakdowns.”
