After being hauled over the coals for apparently shading Cassper, Lvovo has issued an apology, explaining that his comments were a joke. Lvovo and comedian, Pasta Mjosty ruffled feathers on social media after they made comments about another artists coming into their province and filling their stadiums without inviting them. They were referring to Cassper's Fill Up Moses Mabhida Stadium concert last weekend. In a video that topped the trends list the duo spoke about going to Cassper's hometown in the North West to fill up his stadiums. Lvovo returned to Instagram to explain that the comments were made in jest. "It was meant to be a joke. I saw it as a joke but some people didn't. I apologise," he said. Lvovo added that he has no problem with Cassper. "I know some people will say whatever they want to say but the point here it was a joke and I’m sorry to those ppl who didn’t see it as a joke Ngiyaxolisa." Watch the full video here:
