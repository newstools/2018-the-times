The SA Human Rights Commission will conduct a formal and public inquiry into allegations of racism at SuperSport, and will investigate the circumstances that led to former Springbok Ashwin Willemse walking off a set during a live broadcast earlier this year. The terms of reference for that inquiry, which will be held in February next year, include an evaluation of the circumstances that led to “Willemse’s incident with [fellow Supersport analysts Naas Botha and Nick Mallett]” during which he walked off set. It will also examine “whether those facts demonstrate that his dignity or any other fundamental rights were infringed”. The inquiry will also seek to establish: The HRC states in its terms of reference for the inquiry that this process will “be presided over by panellists who will ask questions to the witnesses and proceedings will be recorded”. “The commission will receive both written and oral submissions from SuperSport and other interested parties for the purposes of the inquiry,” it said. This means that the hearing may not just be confined to the evidence of Willemse, Botha and Mallett, but may include testimony for parties who believe they have an interest in the issue. The inquiry is expected to commence on February 25 and is likely to be completed by the end of June.
