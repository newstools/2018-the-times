"The owner, his son and farm employees were subsequently forced into a storeroom. One farmworker aged 31 was shot in the scuffle and he died on his way to hospital," said Rwexana. The suspects fled in a white Toyota Avanza vehicle and a white Volkswagen Golf. Police and farm-watch members were alerted and they arrested two suspects, aged 33 and 35, said Rwexana. "Another suspect, also in his thirties, got killed." A white Volkswagen Golf was seized. Further information was not immediately available. The investigation into the incident is ongoing.
