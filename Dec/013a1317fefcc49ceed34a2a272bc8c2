Hlaudi Motsoeneng reiterated his desire to be president of SA when he appeared in the high court in Johannesburg on Thursday. Motsoeneng is fighting to have the SABC pay him an R11.5m "success bonus". The national broadcaster filed an application to scrap the payment. Judgment in the case was reserved, but that didn’t stop Motsoeneng from telling his supporters that he was confident he would be victorious. He took the opportunity to condemn the ANC for not being more supportive of him during the troubles he continues to face as a result of decisions he made while at the helm of the national broadcaster. "The ANC and other political parties colluded to remove Hlaudi at the SABC. Here is the question: if the ANC said, 'We stand for transformation', they were supposed to defend me." Addressing a crowd outside the court, he reminded his supporters that he believed he was a suitable candidate for the presidency. “I knew what I must do to change people’s lives. I am going to run and lead SA as a president.” According to Motsoeneng, his lack of a matric qualification should not deter people from supporting him. “Don’t listen to people who are talking about qualifications, because there is wisdom in me. If you have wisdom, you know what people want,” he said. This part of his speech did not go down well with those on social media, who do not see Motsoeneng as presidential material.
