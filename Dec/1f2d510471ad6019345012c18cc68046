Two police officers have died in two separate road incidents over the weekend. Police spokesperson Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said the one officer was on-duty and the other off-duty in the separate incidents. On Saturday at around 8.40pm police officers from the Atteridgeville police station near Pretoria were manning a roadblock on the R511 and R512 when a speeding car failed to  stop. “A male constable was knocked down and succumbed to injuries. The member was declared dead on the scene.” Peters said the suspect was allegedly drunk and arrested for culpable homicide and drunk driving. In the second incident, a vehicle with two occupants crashed into a truck on the R21 near Olifantsfontein, north-east of Johannesburg. The driver and the passenger died in the accident, of whom one was a 38-year-old warrant officer stationed at national head office. Acting Gauteng police commissioner Major General Max Masha said: “Our deepest sympathies to the families of our deceased members.”
