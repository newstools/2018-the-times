Motorists who illegally bought their driver’s licences from officials at a testing centre in Cape Town will “not be spared from prosecution” say the Hawks. Six officials and a security guard were arrested at the Lingelethu West driving-licence testing centre, in Khayelitsha, on Wednesday, December 12 2018. “The seven allegedly... charged varying amounts for leaner’s and driver’s licences,” said Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase. The alleged scam operated for nearly four years, between January 2015 and October 2018. “The joint Hawks serious corruption investigation team and Cape department of transport would like to reiterate that those who obtained fraudulent licences will not be spared from prosecution pending the on-going investigations,” warned Nkwalase. Phumla Myedi, 41, Phelisa Kalipa, 40, Leticia Chatburn, 44, Nwabisa Xozwa, 39, Nwabisa Zotani, 31, Zukiswa Ngqalo, 41, and Mbonisi Liwane, 38, appeared in the Bellville Magistrate's Court on Thursday, December 13 2018, on charges of fraud and corruption. They were each released on R2,000 bail, with stringent conditions that they not return to work until the case is finalised. They will return to court on February 12 2019, with Clive Vernon Scheepers, 42, who was arrested on similar charges in November 2018, also at the Lingelethu West testing centre.
