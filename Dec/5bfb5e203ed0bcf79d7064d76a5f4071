One person was killed and at least others injured in a head-on collision between a minibus and a car on the R54 between Fochville and Potchefstroom on Saturday afternoon, paramedics said. “Sadly, the driver of the light motor vehicle was found with fatal injuries and declared dead on the scene. A pregnant woman in the light motor vehicle was found with moderate injuries,” said ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak. A three-year-old girl who was understood to be travelling in the car was critically injured, he said. “The ER24 Oneplan medical helicopter was called to the scene to airlift her to hospital. “At least 16 people from the minibus were treated on the scene for minor to moderate injuries. They were later transported by ER24 and Provincial EMS to local hospitals for further medical care,” Vermaak said.
