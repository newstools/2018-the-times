Basic education minister Angie Motshekga has expressed her disappointment with  public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s finding against Western Cape premier Helen Zille for lending tablets to her son for extra maths lessons in poor schools. Mkhwebane said Zille had a conflict of interest when she facilitated the loan. But Motshekga told Times Select: “How can you say it’s a conflict of interest when it’s in the public interest?”
