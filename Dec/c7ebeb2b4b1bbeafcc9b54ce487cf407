There was mixed reaction on Twitter after former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng launched his own political party, the African Content Movement. Some questioned his reasoning, while others were impressed by his self-belief. During the launch at the Garden Court Milpark Hotel in Johannesburg, Motsoeneng said he would contest  the presidency in the 2019 national elections. His policies include reducing social grants and forcing foreign companies to exit SA.
