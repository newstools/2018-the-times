Cheryl Zondi, the young woman who testified in the pastor Timothy Omotoso trial, is briefing the media on Tuesday. The televangelist and senior pastor of the Jesus Dominion International Church faces multiple charges. These include rape, human trafficking and racketeering. Under harsh, degrading, cross examination, the 22-year old university student told her story of alleged sexual assault that started when she was 14. Zondi received major support from activists groups around the country.
