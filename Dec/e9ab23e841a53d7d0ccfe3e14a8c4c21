While it looked like the Thickleeyonce wave had died down, sis was actually busier than ever behind the scenes. 2018 has been a year of extreme highs and lows for the plus size model, who opened up about a dark space she's found herself in. The influencer and vlogger created a video to share the highlights and lowlights of her year. "The worst part about this year was just the fact that in the last couple of months, I haven't been okay. I've been in this weird place, where I've been living but I don't feel alive, it's like I'm just a zombie." The first ten minutes of the vlog speak about her campaigns and opportunities, while the last part of her vlog revealed that the great days were super bright and the dark days were extremely gloomy. "I'm fighting it, I'm like 'I refuse for you (depression) to take over my life and I refuse for you to bring me into this deep dark hole.' Every day is a fight and every day I choose myself and I choose to be happy and productive. Not let my depression get the best of me because on some days it felt like it was..." she said.
