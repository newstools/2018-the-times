About 500 shacks have been affected by a fire that broke out in Alexandra, Johannesburg, on Thursday afternoon. An eyewitness told eNCA that the fire started after someone took revenge for an attack on Wednesday. “Today around 2pm friends to [sic] those guys who were fighting yesterday [Wednesday], came here to pay [sic] a revenge and then they apparently burnt one shack. Unfortunately, it affected all the shacks around here.” The fire is on the corner of London Road and 18th Avenue. No deaths have been reported. Residents were carrying buckets of water to battle the blaze. The eyewitness said when fire engines arrived there was no water. Johannesberg Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Nana Radebe told eNCA they were struggling to fight the fire because there were not enough fire hydrants and that the water pressure was too weak. “We don’t have hydrants in this area … Some of the areas around here were factories, so the hydrants were here. But you’d find that they [residents] have built on top of the hydrants and the hydrants that are close by to the squatter camp have been used,” Radebe said. “You’d find from time to time when there’s no water, those hydrants are used as a water supply.” Radebe said anyone who wanted to help could drop off food and clothes at the Alex and Sandton fire stations. Times Select reported on November 1 that the City of Johannesburg has only 10 fire engines to service the city’s 31 fire stations, but it needed 29. A tender to supply more vehicles was halted shortly after the DA took over the municipality in 2017, owing to suspected corruption. Almost two years later, a new contract has not been awarded.
