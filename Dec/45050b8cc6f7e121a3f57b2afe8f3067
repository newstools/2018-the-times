French authorities have arrested a man suspected of committing war crimes in the Central African Republic and he will face extradition to The Hague, the International Criminal Court (ICC) said on Tuesday. Prosecutors say Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona was the "senior leader" of the Anti-Balaka militia that carried out systematic attacks on the country's Muslim population in 2013-2014. Ngaissona, who denies wrongdoing, was elected in February to the executive committee of the Confederation of African Football despite objections from groups including Human Rights Watch. It named had him as a leader of the Anti-Balaka in a report in 2016. The ICC said Ngaissona was suspected of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, extermination, deportation, persecution, torture, attacking civilians, and recruiting child soldiers. A chamber at the court "found reasonable grounds to believe Mr Ngaissona is liable for having committed jointly with others ... the above-mentioned crimes." Ethnic and religious conflict has raged for years in Central African Republic. Christian Anti-Balaka militias have been fighting mainly Muslim Seleka rebels after the rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in 2013. Thousands have died in the violence. A court spokesperson confirmed French authorities had carried out the arrest after the warrant was issued on December 7. The ICC had formally requested Ngaissona's transfer. - Reuters
