Celebrity couple Bongi and Collin have long since been dubbed the Romeo & Juliet of the gospel industry, and their love keeps growing. After 12 years of marriage the gospel stars aren't shy to flaunt their love for each other. And rightfully so! Earlier this week Collin penned the sweetest note to his wifey that will have you in your feels. "You are perfect as you are even with your little imperfections, you drive me crazy sometimes, but you also know how to light up the best out of me, I don’t wish to have any other, and I don’t want any other life for I know with you I can only get better. We have grown so much and we only get better with time, thank you for loving me with my flaws and all." Swoon!
