Mzansi's very own beauties, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters and Tamaryn Green are both heating up Thailand ahead of the Miss Universe pageant on December 16. Tamaryn will fly the flag hight at the glitzy event, while Demi-Leigh will hand over the crown to her successor. Both our gals jetted into Thailand ahead of the pageant. And, judging by the snaps are having the time of their lives. Of course they're also serving major sauce in island paradise.
