The debate on the report on land expropriation will move to the National Council of Provinces on Wednesday morning. The National Assembly passed the Constitutional Review Committee's report, with 209 MPs voting in favour of it, 91 voting against it and no abstentions. If the council approves the report, the resolutions taken by both Houses will officially pave way for the amendment of section 25 of the constitution. The ANC has called on parties opposed to expropriation of land without compensation to reconsider their stance, especially their threats to take the process for legal review. Written submissions have become a subject for litigation. AfriForum tried but failed last week to interdict the parliamentary debate and the DA has announced intentions to take parliament to court over a flawed procedural process.
