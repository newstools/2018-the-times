Musician Lvovo faced the wrath of social media on Wednesday after he appeared in a video apparently shading rapper Cassper Nyovest for filling Durban's Moses Mabhida Stadium over the weekend. In a video posted to Lvovo's Instagram page on Wednesday, the muso and comedian PastaÂ Mjosty discuss another artist coming into their province and filling their stadiums without inviting them. They talk about going to Cassper's hometown in the North West to fill up his stadiums like he had done in their hood. Fans were convinced that malume Lvovo was throwing not only shade but the whole tree at Cassper. Lvovo later deleted the video as the backlash started growing on Thursday morning. One of the first people to react to the video was Lvovo's "crush" and model Thickleeyonce. Commenting on the post she labelled his behaviour "unnecessary and childish". Hulisani Ravele was also outraged at the post and claimed she was quarter to a serious rant. Cassper responded by simply sharing a link to the video and asked fans for their take on it. Fans grabbed their pitchforks and went for Lvovo.
