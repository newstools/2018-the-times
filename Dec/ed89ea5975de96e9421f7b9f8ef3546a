President Cyril Ramaphosa named advocate Shamila Batohi the new head of the NPA and Twitter quickly gave her the stamp of approval. Mzansi was impressed with how Batohi handled herself during her interview at the Union Buildings in November. Batohi has vast experience in the legal space. She takes on the NPA challenge armed with expertise she has gained at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands. She also led evidence during the King Commission that interrogated the cricket match-fixing allegations involving the late Hansie Cronje. Among the people who wished the new NPA boss well is her predecessor Shaun Abrahams and EFF leader Julius Malema. "Her strength will be shown through the prosecution of high-profile cases which involve politicians of South Africa, particularly from the ruling party," said Malema Many others took to social media to congratulate Batohi and say they are looking forward to firm action from the new boss.
