Former Springboks captain Victor Matfield turned down the opportunity to become the Bulls' head coach in next season's Super Rugby in the eleventh hour as he wanted job security. Blue Bulls Company (BBCO) on Tuesday announced Pote Human as the coach on a one-year deal after Matfield‚ who was their first choice‚ turned down the opportunity to return to the venue that saw him lift three Super Rugby titles as a player. Human himself confirmed that he was only informed that he had got the job on Monday after Matfield apparently changed his mind late last week. “It is difficult because he (Matfield) is not here to answer for himself but what he informed me was the insecurity of being a coach‚” said BBCO chairman Willem Strauss. “You can ask the question of why he went through the whole process but it is tough to be a coach. "It is a high risk environment and we all know that‚ but I can summarise it by saying it came down to that. "Maybe when he looked at the high risk situation he felt it he was better off being where he is now for his family. I guess it was a personal decision that he took.” Strauss also could not respond adequately when asked how the Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus is going to help Human during pre-season in January. “I don’t want to speak on behalf of SA Rugby but Pote is meeting Rassie in the next couple of days and we will have more clarity‚" he said. "From my understanding‚ he will be here from the 3rd of January in his capacity as Director of SA Rugby and it is his job to upskill the franchises. "Once Pote has met with him‚ we will have a little bit more clarity as to his day to day activities while he is with us.” The Bulls have also appointed respected Alan Zondagh as Director of Rugby and he will oversee the rugby structures at Loftus while supporting Human and his management team.
