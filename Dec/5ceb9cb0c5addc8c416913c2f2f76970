Footage has emerged of a man verbally assaulting a nurse in a clinic - and even aggressively tapping her on the shoulder. The verbal abuse lasts for over a minute and a half. “I'm not afraid of standing in front of the court with you because of the s**t you are doing. Your f****n s***t!” the man says to the healthcare worker. "I'll bash your mouth in until you tell the truth at the police station," the unidentified man continues in his tirade. In the video, the man seems to claim that the nurse refused to help him because of a minor mistake to do with a form that was filled out.
