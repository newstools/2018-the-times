Rapper AKA is the latest big name star to be roasted on Comedy Central and ahead of the event early next year, he has set down some guidelines. It was announced on Thursday morning that the Supa Mega would face the firing squad on February 21. Although the people who will be on the panel roasting him hasn't yet been released, AKA has already cleared the air on who is and isn't allowed to be there. "I don't want my family involved, but I want Somizi on the panel. I want Pearl Thusi. I want D'Banj," he told Metro FM's DJ Fresh. He even said his bitter rival Cassper Nyovest and his ex Bonang Matheba were invited. "Maybe if Cassper wants to do it, he is welcome. Maybe we can even get Queen B on the panel." He said that he wanted his family to be left out of it. "My kid and the mother of my child. I don't want the mother of my child or child involved," he added. We wonder if anyone will be able to school the master of shade and sub-tweets? The roast will take place at the The Teatro at Montecasino in Johannesburg, with tickets now available for the live recording. It comes just months after the Roast of Somizi. That event was the highest rated South African roast to date, where Roast Master Gareth Cliff led a panel of DJ Fresh, Nomzamo Mbatha, Skhumba, Fikile Mbalula, Kurt Darren, Ntsiki Mazwai, Schalk Bezuidenhout and Joanne Joseph.
