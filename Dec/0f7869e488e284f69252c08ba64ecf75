Veteran actress and activist Florence Masebe has revealed that SA's actors can celebrate as parliament has officially passed the Performers Protection Amendment Bill. After a fight that was long overdue, it looks like SA's performers and artists will finally get treated like the royalty they are. Florence shared the news on Wednesday after the ANC parliament Twitter account tweeted that MPs had agreed to the bill and that it had been sent to the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) for concurrence. Over two months ago, Florence took the fight for fair treatment of artists to parliament and challenged them to pass the Performers Protection Amendment Bill. In her speech Florence pleaded with parliament to save actors from the "blatant exploitation" they are subjected to. Florence could only say "thank you" and went on to celebrate on Twitter. People on Twitter flooded Florence's timeline with messages of gratitude for her contribution.
