Opposition candidate Martin Fayulu has become the clear favourite to win Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC's) long-delayed election on Sunday, with the government-backed candidate trailing in third place, according to a new poll. Fayulu, a former Exxon Mobil manager, was little known when he was picked as the joint candidate of an opposition coalition in November, but extensive campaigning, including in Ebola-hit eastern regions, has since boosted his profile. The latest election poll by a New York-based research group showed Fayulu leapfrogging from third place in October to the top spot with 44% support. He was ahead of the former frontrunner, opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi, on 23%, and the ruling party's Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary on 18%. "The polls reveal an electorate eager for change. A large majority supports the opposition," Congo Research Group (CRG), which commissioned the polling on which the survey was based, said in a statement. "Fayulu ... is the clear favourite to win elections if they are free and fair," it said in a statement. The opposition has repeatedly expressed concern over the authorities' handling of the election, meant to bring about the first democratic transition of power in the vast, mineral-rich central African country.
