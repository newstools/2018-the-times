Musician Jack Parow has come under heavy criticism after posting a homophobic message on his social media accounts. The image, in which the word 'moffie' is used, went viral on social media on Tuesday night. Jack has since apologised, saying that it was a meme created by his social media manager. Although Parow said he is not trying to shift the blame, he did say that he did not have time to look at the post "properly" before it was posted. He also went on to say that he has many friends and family in the gay community and understands the "struggles they went through." Not everybody bought the apology though, with many saying he was shifting the blame and pointing out how long it took him to apologise.
