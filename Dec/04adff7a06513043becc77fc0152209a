TV and radio personality Zizo Tshwete has paid glowing tribute to actress Simz Ngema for her incredible strength. Zizo attended the late Dumi Masilela's album launch, which Simz released on her husband's behalf and walked away feeling inspired. "This is @simzngema!!! I’m going to say that again - This is @simzngema the definition of a QUEEN! Today I have the privilege of being at the album launch of #EternalCrush on behalf of her husband @dumimasilela. If I used the word ‘strong’ to describe her it would be a gross understatement!" Zizo added that even though she didn't understand Simz' journey she has an incredible amount of respect for her. "We live amongst real life heroines! Qhawekazi. I cannot imagine her journey but I fully respect her! Life is short guys - we need to be on each other’s sides and not opponents. I have always loved this woman from a distance."
