The Daily Show's Trevor Noah had a sit down with rapper Meek Mill this week that has been hailed as one of the "realest" interview the rapper has ever had about his time in prison. Tweeps gave props to Trevor for creating an atmosphere that allowed Meek to express himself without fear and give his version of events on prison life. Meek opened up about the reality of prison and how things needed to change. "No, it's really like a mental institution. A lot of people are addicts and went to prison for probation violations, because they were addicted to opioids, marijuana, cocaine; and they are put in prisons. But I think that that type of thing should be handled accordingly. People that have addictions should go to rehab, they shouldn't go to prison," Meek Mill said. The rapper explained that there were so many layers to the stories that come out of prison and that so many people were in there when they really shouldn't be. Meek has a long list of encounters with the law but spoke particularly about the time he was sent toÂ a medium-security prison for two to four years over minor infractions, including popping a wheelie without wearing a helmet. "I wheeled a dirt bike. I went from wheeling a dirt bike to being locked in a cell 23 hours a day with shackles on my ankles and on my wrist, and not being able to contact my family. (I was) going through traumatising things and I'm just like 'yo! I'm not a threat to society'.
