Okay! 2018 needs to end before tweeps are subjected to anymore "silly" twars from your faves. Pearl Thusi and Lasizwe had a whole spicy (and perhaps unnecessary) exchange of words on the TL over the song Beyoncé put on her video. After making South Africa wait for a little over two weeks, Beyoncé finally posted memories from her time in SA over the Global Citizen Festival weekend.  She even used DJ Maphorisa's song, iWalk Ye Phara, as her background soundtrack in one of her videos. This made most South Africans very happy but it was also the beginning of a twar for Pearl and Lasizwe. The twar began very lightly after Lasizwe said Maphorisa's song sounded "nicer" now that it had been recognised by the OG Queen B. That's when Pearl asked him if it was not nice before the recognition. Lasizwe explained that he said it jokingly and that he meant to say imply that being recognised by Bey is a big deal. Then Pearl gave Lasizwe a mini lesson on over-glorifying "international validation" to which Lasizwe responded by asking her if she didn't travel all the way to America to seek the same validation she appeared to be shooting down. Uhm... That's when sh*t got real and real personal too. We talkin' pay cheque personal. Nevermind the fact that the twar had basically happened on a Wednesday night (for a lot of hours), the pair were still sending subtweets to each other on Thursday. *sigh*
