After a scorching week with temperatures averaging over 30°c, Joburgers can look forward to a cooler week ahead. The heatwave, which lasted for three days, swept through parts of Gauteng and Limpopo. The South African Weather Services also issued a fire danger warning, with extremely high fire danger conditions in the Northern Cape, North West, Free State, Limpopo and Gauteng. According to this week's forecast, people in Johannesburg can expect relief from the heat for the rest of the week and well into the weekend. Expected temperatures for the next four days, starting on Friday, are 28°c, 26°c, 24°c and 24°c for Monday. But don't pack away the sunscreen just yet. Weather Services communications manager Hannalee Doubell said weekly forecasts were more reliable than attempting to predict the month ahead. Doubell said: "The results of an extended forecast become much less accurate for longer periods so it's difficult to say what the rest of the month of December will bring." While Gauteng can celebrate the cool days ahead, the rest of the festive season could be  different. Cape Town also has weather news to celebrate. Rain is predicted for Friday and according to the weather service, 15mm will fall. This gives farmers and residents a better outlook as the city still keeps a watch on dam levels.
