Rescue technicians pulled the body of a man from the Dakota Beach lagoon in Isipingo, south of Durban, on Tuesday morning. In a separate incident, another man drowned on Durban's Golden Mile while swimming with two friends early Tuesday. His body has not been recovered. The body found on a sandbank in Isipingo was spotted in the lagoon by a passing fisherman, who called the police. Officers placed the body in a bag and carried it across the beach to a mortuary vehicle. The circumstances of his death will be determined by an inquest. Police divers continued their search for the man who disappeared in the sea on Durban’s Golden Mile. It is understood that the man had been swimming with two friends just after 5am - before municipal lifeguards report for duty. One of the men began to struggle and quickly disappeared beneath the surface, with his friends scrambling to shore to raise the alarm. Members of the police’s search and rescue unit have been searching for the man for most of the morning, with the effort expected to continue into the afternoon. The victim has yet to be named by police.
