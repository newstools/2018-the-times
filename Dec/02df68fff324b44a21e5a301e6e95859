Metro police bungling has been blamed for the chaos at the Global Citizen Festival last weekend, with the company that runs the FNB Stadium confirming that traffic officers arrived seven hours late and ignored the traffic security plan. The bungle could see senior officials criminally charged under legislation put in place after the 2001 Ellis Park disaster in which 43 people died. The JMPDâ€™s service was so poor that a private security company had to be called in at noon to assist. While the department this week declined to comment, saying the issue had been "escalated to parliament", several senior sources told how certain roads were not closed at prescribed times, resources were not deployed to key locations at prescribed times and critical road closures were changed, preventing buses accessing dedicated routes. As a result, incoming traffic met the outgoing traffic and the gridlock took several hours to untangle, ultimately leading to a terrifying crime spree outside the stadium.
