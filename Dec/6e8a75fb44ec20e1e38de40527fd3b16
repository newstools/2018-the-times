A woman recently asked MaKhumalo' for a lil advice on whether she could abandon her "main chick" duties this Dezemba to go live her best life, but MaKhumalo set her straight, giving her the 'how to be a good wife' guidelines. The woman, whose name wasn't mentioned, said she planned on ignoring her commitment to her steady boyfriend to be free this festive. She was speaking on the Gagasi FM Love and Relationships feature. "There's no going back. When you are in a serious relationship, you need to prioritise your partner over your friends. They need to understand that you are splitting yourself between them and him." On Uthando Nes'thembu, Musa Mseleku's third wife Thobile, aka MaKhumalo, is known for her pearls of wisdom. She told the woman that whatever relationship she fed with her time, would thrive.
