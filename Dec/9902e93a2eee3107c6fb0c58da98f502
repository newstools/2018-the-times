Dramatic CCTV footage captured the moment when a minibus taxi ploughed into a car in central Ballito, north of Durban, and killed a pedestrian at the weekend. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesman Paul Herbst said medics went to the scene, near the townâ€™s Lifestyle Centre. "It is believed that the taxi was traveling towards the N2 when a light motor vehicle turning right towards the Lifestyle Centre collided with it at the intersection. Following the impact, the taxi veered on to the pavement, colliding with a pedestrian," he said. The woman died at the scene.
