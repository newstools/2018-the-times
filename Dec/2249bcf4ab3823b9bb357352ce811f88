A police constable guarding Helen Zille's house is undergoing therapy after she was allegedly attacked by the Western Cape premier's rottweiler. According to documents seen by the Sunday Times, the 34-year-old woman constable hurt her knee and wrist in October last year when trying to evade the dog. The officer had surgery as a result, the documents say. The Sunday Times understands she is still receiving therapy and taking medication. Police union leaders said this week at least two other officers have had to take evasive action because of the premier’s dogs. In one instance, they say, an officer fired a warning shot to scare them off. Zille said this week protection officers had been frightened of the dogs even though they had not tried to attack them. “Our dogs have never attacked anyone on these premises,” she said.
