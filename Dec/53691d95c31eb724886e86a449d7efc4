A Durban hijack victim had a fortuitous escape when police officers pursued and stopped a suspicious vehicle - rescuing the motorist from the clutches of robbers. The incident occurred at about 11pm on Thursday last week. Police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala said in a statement on Sunday the hijacked vehicle was spotted in Umlazi J Section, with three occupants inside. "Once the suspects noticed the police officers, they immediately abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot. Police gave chase and apprehended a 21-year-old suspect. He was then searched and found in illegal possession of a firearm as well as a pair of silver handcuffs. "The team then searched the vehicle and upon opening the boot, they found the hijacked victim inside." The victim identified the suspect as one of the men who robbed him of his silver Toyota Etios. The hijacker's accomplices managed to evade arrest and are still being sought by police. The arrested suspect is expected to appear in the Umlazi Magistrateâ€™s Court on Tuesday, on charges of illegal possession of a firearm and armed robbery.
