5 local stories that topped Twitter trends lists this week. Before visiting news sources for the latest headlines, many people start by checking social media trends lists to see what's happening locally and abroad. These are five hashtags that caught the attention of South Africans this week. #BlackTwitterTipsForUBaba Jacob Zuma has been a hit on Twitter since he joined the network a week ago. Given that navigating social media can be tricky for newcomers, the public set about helping him. Under #BlackTwitterTipsForUBaba they gave him tips on things to avoid online. #HelenZille The hashtag referencing the Western Cape premier's name trended soon after public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane announced her findings about tablets that had been lent  to Helen Zille's son, Paul Maree. Maree is a teacher and in 2014 gave maths lessons to underprivileged children. Mkhwebane ruled that Maree had an "unfair advantage" because his mother used her position to benefit her son. Maree was not paid for the lessons. #Maphorisa DJ Maphorisa enjoyed a few hours at top spot on trends lists after Beyoncé posted a Global Citizen Festival highlights package on her Instagram account. For her video's background music, she chose the track iWalk Ye Para by Dj Maphorisa, DJ Raybel, Moonchild Sanelly, K.O. and Zulu Mkhathini. Queen B's song choice sent Twitter into a frenzy. #ChickenLicken On Tuesday, the hashtag that captivated SA Twitter was #ChickenLicken, and the cause was the ban on the franchise's Big Mjohnana advert. The Advertising Regulatory Board ordered Chicken Licken to pull the advert, which is a spoof of colonialism and shows African Big Mjohnana "discovering" Europe. The board concluded that the commercial made a mockery of the trauma associated with colonisation. Many people on Twitter didn't agree. #BabyDaniel The #BabyDaniel hashtag echoed calls for harsh sentences for child abusers after a judgment was handed down for the death of a three-year old. The court ruled that the child's stepfather was responsible for the toddler's death and the mother "turned a blind eye" to what was going on. The courts and the media called the child Baby R and Baby Daniel to protect the mother's other children.
