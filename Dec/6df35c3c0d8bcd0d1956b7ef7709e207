"People's Blesser" Malcolm X has moved to squash rumours he tied the knot this past weekend, explaining that the elaborate celebrations were simply a birthday party. Pics of a fancy event surfaced online this week, several of which were posted by his bae Stella, raising speculations about a wedding. Despite the fact that the captions pointed towards a birthday party, people still got excited. So Malcolm tok to Instagram to calm everyone down. "Let me clarify this: last Saturday was a birthday party for Stella and not her wedding," he wrote. He explained that the wedding will be a show-stopper and even feature a big-name performer from New York, performing in two cities. "Her wedding will be a hip- hop wedding with a New York Rapper performing live in Rustenburg & Johannesburg. Her bae just told me," he said, teasingly. Speaking to TshisaLIVE in August, Malcolm said the pair met several years ago and are hoping to tie the knot next year. "We are doing very well and are hoping to get married by the end of next year. We thought maybe this year but there has been a lot to do, business wise, and so we're super busy." He said that it took five years to win her over and countless romantic getaways. "I bought her flowers and did everything I could to try convince her that I really wanted to be with her. We even went for a weekend away at Zimbali to get to know each other".
