Comedian and actor Casper de Vries is recovering after an embarrassing experience led to him being found naked and bloodied in the streets of Linden, Johannesburg. Taking to Instagram, Casper shared pictures of his badly bruised face with an explanation of the mishap. The comedian apparently took sleeping pills with a gulp of vodka. "Never drink sleeping pills and then wash it down with clean Skyy vodka. @deepfriedman found me passed out naked in the streets of Linden, bruised and bloodied. Kent (his dog) was missing. I think I wanted to take him for a walk. But he f**ked off. "I remember nothing. Even hurt my neck & am now wearing Montelleâ€™s brace. Kent came back. Nursing bruises and scratches on my legs. Feel sorry please. And then you may laugh." According to Netwerk 24, Casper rents on Deep Fried Man's property, who put him to bed after discovering him in the streets. The publication further claims that Casper recently started taking anti-depressants.
