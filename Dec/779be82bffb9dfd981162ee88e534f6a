A man was killed and two others sustained moderate injuries when their vehicle crashed down an embankment into the parking lot of a hardware store in Johannesburg South on Saturday morning. ER24 spokesman Werner Vermaak said that paramedics from ER24 and other services had arrived on the scene at about 7.30am to find the bakkie lying on its side in the parking lot next to the N12 highway near the Kliprivier off-ramp. “Bystanders explained that the vehicle crashed through the barrier and the fence before it landed in the parking lot. Sadly, one of the occupants was found with fatal injuries. There was nothing that paramedics could do for him and he was declared dead on the scene,” Vermaak said. “The driver and another occupant were treated on the scene for moderate injuries before they were transported to a nearby hospital for further care,” he added.
