Only four weeks after its official launch by President Cyril Ramaphosa, the police's anti-gang unit in Cape Town has arrested two of its own members. Two officers were arrested on Tuesday following an investigation of a theft complaint after the unit executed a raid in Mitchells Plain, said police spokesman FC van Wyk. “The two constables, a 35-year-old male and a 38-year-old female, attached to Western Cape anti-gang unit visible policing section, are accused of stealing money from a residence in Peugeot Street, Beacon Valley, where they conducted a search on November 29,” said Van Wyk. “The complainant discovered that cash was taken from a safe in his house after they had left, and reported the matter to police. "It is also alleged that the two constables approached the complainant again on December 2 and requested him to withdraw the case against them in return for the stolen money. “The two suspects are detained until their court appearance in Mitchells Plain on Thursday on a charge of theft.” Western Cape police commissioner Khombinkosi Jula said he was determined corruption would not taint the anti-gang unit. “No SAPS member is above the law, and we will not allow any of our members to perpetrate a crime and get away with it. We are confident this morning’s arrests will send a stern warning,” he said.
