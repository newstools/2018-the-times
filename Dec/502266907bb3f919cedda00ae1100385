Apart from low blood pressure, former Springbok hooker Naka Drotské is “100%”, his wife Marzanne said on Sunday. “The doctor gave him permission to keep his laptop with him because he feels he needs to keep his mind busy,” she said in a statement. Naka will undergo an operation to his right arm and elbow on Tuesday. “We believe he will be discharged on Thursday or Friday! … Your prayers have carried us and Naka is now sitting reading the newspaper. It is like a miracle!!!” Drotské was shot three times during a robbery on Thursday night at his brother Tinus’s smallholding in Kameeldrift in Pretoria. He was with former Springbok and Cheetahs teammate Os du Randt, Tinus and Tinus’s three children when four men barged into the house at 9:15pm. Tinus told the Sunday Times on Saturday: “He’s doing much better this morning but he’s still in the intensive care unit and they’ve put him in isolation so that he can’t attract bacteria.” He added they were grateful the bullets had missed his vital organs. “We were worried about the one [bullet] that went through his intestines but he’s doing fine. He is due for more operations on Thursday to fix his elbow that was hit by a bullet.” Drotské lives in Bloemfontein but will stay in Pretoria while he recuperates. He played 26 tests for the Springboks and was a member of the Rugby World Cup winning team in 1995.
