A classic 1939 Alfa Romeo is expected to fetch around $25m at a French auction in February 2019, and even those who can’t afford the hefty price tag are drooling. According to Reuters, the car still has its original engine and will be among a fleet of vintage vehicles that will go under the hammer at the Artcurial Motors auction. Head of Artcurial Motorcars Matthieu Lamoure gushed over the car. “It was the fastest pre-war car and the shape, the line is absolutely amazing.” Motor1 reports that the 1939 Alfa Romeo BC 2900B Touring Berlinetta is one of many classics that will be auctioned. Others include a 1931 Bugatti 51 Grand Prix and a 1953 Maserati A6CGS. The Alfa Romeo Berlinetta is drawing a lot of attention because only five of the models produced featured the Touring bodywork. The car has only had four owners and has the same configuration it had when it left the factory floor. The current owner has driven it for more than four decades. The last time vintage car enthusiasts were this excited about a 1939 Alfa Romeo was in 2016, when a Lungo Spider was auctioned for $19,8m.
