Festive gifting is easy when you can buy with the click of a button. With Polo’s new online store, you can get their classic clothes delivered straight to your door. The recently launched e-commerce platform has an easy-to-navigate design that will highlight why shopping online is a great alternative to buying in-store. Polo’s staples — the golfer, the striped shirt and monogrammed pony handbag — are just some of the items available online. You’ll also find men’s and women’s tees, custom-fit men’s shirts, as well as a range of children’s tees, blouses and dresses for summer. For the 42-year-old South African brand, going online is key to giving customers a more convenient shopping option.  “As a tried-and-trusted part of South African culture, we know how important it is to cater to customers on the platforms they prefer, and e-commerce is certainly a growing phenomenon,” said Polo managing director Mark Oliver.
