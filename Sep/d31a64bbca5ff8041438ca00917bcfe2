Forget about your triple cheeseburger and go for broke with this monster, possibly the biggest hamburger on Earth. It's made of two giant patties, four strips of pork belly, jalapenos, Tater tots, flamin' hot cheetos, several handfuls of cheese, loads of sauce and four fried eggs all piled onto a giant bun. Would you sink your teeth into it?
