Government has called on people not to share a “disturbing video” circulating on social media that claims to depict a young man being confronted for allegedly raping a child in the bathroom of a Dros restaurant in Pretoria. The graphic video depicts a naked man‚ partly covered in blood in a bathroom‚ being confronted by several people. TimesLIVE is in possession of the video‚ but has chosen not to publish it at this stage. While the suspect appeared briefly in court on Tuesday - and has allegedly been identified by social media - by law he cannot be named until he has pleaded. He is in police custody and is expected to appear in court again on October 2. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has indicated it will oppose bail. “What is this?” someone asks in the video. “What the f**k?!” someone else shouts. The man leans back against the wall‚ covering his penis with his left hand. “I came inside to (use the toilet). [For] f**k’s sake‚” he shouts. “What the f***k is wrong with you guys! Dude‚ look at this! There’s nothing f*cking wrong with me! I’m sober. I’m a mental man (sic)! I’m f****g okay. I’ve got a tab running at the bar!” South Africa’s official government Twitter handle warned people not to share the video on Thursday evening, saying it was insensitive to the child and her family and could jeopardise the legal processes. The NPA  said the man has been charged with rape‚ possession of drugs‚ intimidation and assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
