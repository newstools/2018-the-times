Actor Menzi Ngubane celebrated his birthday by spending the day with children at the Ethembeni Home in Doornfontein in Johannesburg. Instead of splurging out on a fancy party, Menzi decided to donate groceries to the home and treat the kids to some sugary snacks. He described the day as "special and beautiful". "None of them is a mistake. I don't know and understand why they got abandoned but what I know for sure is it wasn't their fault, there's nothing wrong with them. They're lovely, adorable, they're so special and their future is bright".
