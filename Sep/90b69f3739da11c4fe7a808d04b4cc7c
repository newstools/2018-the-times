A new poll shows that the EFF is eating President Cyril Ramaphosa's lunch. According to an Institute for Race Relations (IRR) survey, Julius Malema's party has doubled its support to 13% while the ANC has dropped from 62% to 52% — only just holding on to its majority. The poll said party support countrywide is as follows: • The EFF is polling at 13% • The ANC is polling at 52% • The DA is polling at 23% In addition, the IRR said no party enjoyed a clear majority in Gauteng, signaling that the province, like its major cities Tshwane and Johannesburg, could be governed by a coalition. "Land reform polls worst as a priority government issue," the IRR said. The poll was conducted between August 22 2018 and September 4 2018, and canvassed just less than 1,000 registered voters.
