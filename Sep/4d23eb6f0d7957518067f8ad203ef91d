Radio personality Ntombee Ngcobo-Mzolo has revealed that her bundle of joy, Linile Vunani Mzolo has arrived. Taking to Instagram on Monday, Ntombee announced the news by sharing a video. She said that she was enjoying every moment with Baby LV. Baby LV comes three years after Ntombee's newborn son, Dunamis died after being diagnosed with a rare heart condition. "I felt like I was robbed of the experience of mothering him. I didn't really feel part of the process of giving birth to him because I had a c-section to make sure his birth was smooth and quick as possible. But I didn't get to breastfeed, bath him or play with him," she told Drum magazine in an interview last month. Last month Ntombee's friends came together to through her a special baby shower ahead of LV's arrival.
