Footage of an elephant gatecrashing a familyâ€™s lunch in the bush in Zimbabwe has found its way onto social media. "Don't move," the man shooting the video says to his family as the elephant moves up to the family's table. Towering above the man's head, the curious animal can be heard knocking items over on the table, before it moves off, clearly unimpressed with the lunch on offer.
