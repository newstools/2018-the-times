The driver was arrested while trying to cross the border into Zimbabwe after he had been discharged from hospital‚ said Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe. "As the process of intensive investigations by the police was unfolding‚ especially on the possible cause of that accident‚ he disappeared following his discharge from hospital and fled towards the Beit Bridge port of entry‚" said Ngoepe.
