Thando Thabethe made a young girl's dream a reality when she surprised her at home to hand over one of her designer dresses. In March, Thando announced that she would be giving away three of red carpet dresses to three fans for their matric dances. One of the winners was Mpumi who totally lost her mind when Thando rocked up at her home.
