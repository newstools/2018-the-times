Lynne Brown wants to clear her name at the State Capture inquiry. Her lawyers will apply for cross-examination of witnesses. Deputy chief justice Raymond Zondo has granted Duduzane Zuma leave to cross-examine former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. He, however, rejected the application by Ajay and Rajesh Gupta to cross-examine Jonasâ€š former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and former GCIS boss Themba Maseko. Zondo rejected the Guptas' application as they were outside the country and are not prepared to return.
