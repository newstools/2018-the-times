The FNB Joburg Art Fair, which has been billed as "Africaâ€™s leading contemporary art expo", returns to the Sandton Convention Centre this year. Since 2008, the FNB Joburg Art Fair has hosted over 200 galleries, non-profits and institutions. The focus of this year's celebration: celebrating galleries who have grown with the fair; artists who drive the discourse; patrons who have unwaveringly supported the fair and the audience whose curiosity has only grown over the years. It runs until September 9, 2018.
