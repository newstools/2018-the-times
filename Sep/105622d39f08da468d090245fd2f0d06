The whole of RDM is mourning with the families,” RDM chief executive Norbert Schulze said. The factory on the outskirts of Cape Town consists of 400 buildings‚ each with blast walls to prevent a chain reaction during an explosion. It manufactures artillery ammunition. Schulze said earlier that the employees would have been mixing about a tonne of propellant and it would have ignited in milliseconds. “Usually we talk about ignition like burning‚ but this was a detonation. We have no idea what caused this detonation.” The explosion destroyed the entire building and the surrounding walls. Rheinmetall Waffe Munition (RWM) in Germany and Denel concluded an equity partnership in 2007 wherein a majority interest in Denel’s Munition business was sold to RWM with a 51% (RWM) and 49% (Denel) equity shareholding.
