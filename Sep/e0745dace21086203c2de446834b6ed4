A murder trail recorded in Mpumalanga and Gauteng has left police investigating the possibility that they are dealing with a pair of serial killers, preying on elderly women. Three months and four bodies later, Johnny du Plooy, 26, and Shaun Oosthuizen, 38, from Munsieville on Gautengâ€™s West Rand were finally arrested back in their home town. In all the cases the same modus operandi was used: overpowering the aged women and stuffing their mouths with a cloth before tying them up and making off with small items that are easy to transport and sell.
