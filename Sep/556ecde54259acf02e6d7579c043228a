Photographs of a grand piano covered with a fitted red cloth, snaps of “black granite” steps and pictures of their guest toilet – this is the bizarre “evidence” family patriarch Ajay Gupta submitted to the state capture inquiry to discredit former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor. The grainy pictures of the inside and outside of the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home are attached to an affidavit Ajay Gupta filed to Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, who heads the commission of inquiry into state capture. This 42-page affidavit, obtained by Times Select, was filed alongside the Guptas’ application to testify via video link instead of travelling to South Africa.
