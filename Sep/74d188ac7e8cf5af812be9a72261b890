A rare two-headed copperhead snake was found in a Virginia garden in the US. Imagine four fangs, not just two! The Washington PostÂ  reports "it was a unique find in the herpetology world because two-headed snakes rarely occur in the wild." In a Facebook post, The Virginia Department of Game and Fisheries says "the snake is being cared for by a private reptile keeper with lots of experience in breeding and caring for venomous snakes. Although it did successfully feed over the weekend, it still has a long way to go before we are confident of its survival. If successful, we hope to eventually place it with a zoological facility within the state."
