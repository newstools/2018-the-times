On the track "Greatest"‚ Em raps: "I know there's people that are pissed about the way I mispronounced a name‚ DIE ANTWOORD! F**k‚ I still can't say this s**t‚ but how quickly they forget / Who the f**k I was now Ninja try to duck my slugs / To let ya girl get f***ed by Muggs.” Die Antwoord lashed back in a video response that begins: "Yo‚ Em‚ how you doing‚ brah? Sorry we haven’t hit you back in a second but we just heard your new shit. You’re so funny." WARNING: The video below contains explicit language Long may the rap battles continue.
