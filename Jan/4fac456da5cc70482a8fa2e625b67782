Platinum Stars coach Roger de Sa has backed Mamelodi Sundowns to win the league title this season. Sundowns beat Stars 3-0 and De Sa said the league title is Sundowns' to lose. "I think Sundowns can only lose itâ€š" De Sa said. "They have given away some games. "I watched their 3-2 loss to Pirates and I thought Sundowns should have been 5-0 up by half-time. "I think it's going to take a lot to beat Sundowns with all the new signings they've got. "I will be surprised if they don't win the championship. "I think there's a little of a gap between Sundowns and the rest."
