Taste is a subjective thing, we know, but when you gather a group of Sunday Times readers together and ask them to blind-taste house brand products from four of the big retailers, there will be winners and losers. It's worth noting that there is a difference between no-name and house brands. Pickn Pay and Checkers offer both no-name and house, or private-label, brands, whereas Spar and Woolworths stock house brands. These brands offer retailers the opportunity to negotiate better deals with suppliers. The guarantee is that it does not mean a compromise on quality. Or does it? To find out, we presented our readers with eight different house brand products including spaghetti, tinned tuna, tinned peach slices in syrup, mayonnaise, tinned chickpeas, tinned whole peeled tomatoes, vanilla ice cream and baked beans in tomato sauce. Four samples of each type of the same product were presented to readers on a platter, without packaging or branding. The readers were asked to compare and judge them on appearance, taste, texture, quality and say whether they would buy them or not. To ensure credibility, auditor Jade Craig oversaw the preparation and plating of the products by chefs from the HTA Cooking Academy as well as the tasting and scoring processes. She also tallied the scores, giving an average for each product. Each brand was cooked to package instructions, drained and very lightly tossed in olive oil before serving.
