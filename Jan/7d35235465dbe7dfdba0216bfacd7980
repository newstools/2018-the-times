Actresses Jo-Anne Reyneke and Simz Ngema showed off their dance skills after attempting to remake some of the moves from Sarafina. Jo-Anne posted the video to her Instagram account and commented on how unfit the pair are. "So @simzngema and I decide to remake Safarina for ourselves! Brutal reminder of how unfit we are! Buy the end we are barely standing." Fit or not, it's good to see Simz smiling.
