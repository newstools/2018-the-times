"According to information at police disposal‚ the trio broke a window and gained entry into the dining room of the house‚ where a 50-year-old woman is staying with her children and grandchildren‚" police said in a statement. "Upon hearing the noise of the breaking window‚ the woman and her 18-year-old daughter came out of their rooms to investigate what was happening. They were threatened at gunpoint to be silent.

Community members searched the area while the police were called. "Nothing else was taken from the house except the two children whose whereabouts still remain unknown‚" said police.
