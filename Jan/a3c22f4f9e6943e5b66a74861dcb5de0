Getting Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and director Steven Spielberg to work together on a film – also a first for the two actors – is an almost surefire recipe for success. Their Oscar-nominated new film The Post is about Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), publisher Katharine Graham (Streep) and their fight in 1971 to publish the Pentagon Papers, the explosive revelations about the futility of the Vietnam War made by whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg. “Written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, this newspaper drama focuses not on reporters but on management. It’s very much the story of Graham, insecure and struggling to make herself heard in a man's world, taking a stand and doing the right thing in the face of enormous pressures from her Washington insider friends, the Nixon government and her shareholders,” wrote Sunday Times columnist Tymon Smith, who also interviewed Streep, Hanks and Spielberg on camera. Watch the interview The Post is an Academy Award nominee for best film of the year and best leading actress (Streep), and received six Golden Globes nominations: best film, best director, best screenplay, best actor and actress in a drama (Hanks and Streep), and best original score (John Williams).
