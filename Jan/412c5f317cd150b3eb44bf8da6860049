Always pack your favourite holiday fragrance to freshen up your scent after a day at the beach. This one from Jo Malone with notes of sea weed, sea salt and sage makes for an unforgettable beach bag companion. Though makeup isn’t a main concern at the beach – especially since it will all disappear after a dip in the water – pack some sort of a colour tint for the lips, whether it’s a balm or sheer lipstick to add a punch of colour to your face after you've dried off. Freshen up hair after a beach day just in time for sundowners by packing a dry shampoo to lightly blast tresses and absorb any sweat or grease. The texturising salt from the sea water left behind once your hair dries with will do the rest. At the beach, it's all about the glowing skin. So dust an iridescent powder over your cheekbones and décolletage for an eye-catching shimmer. Take your glow to the next level and use a shimmering body oil to accentuate your tan or give darker skin tones a lacquer-like glow. Your beach bag is never complete without packing a high protection sunscreen.  Go for a sunscreen with an SPF50 that also absorbs seamlessly into the skin – opt for a spray application bottle or a sunscreen with a milky formula that glides onto skin and seeps in. Ensure that your skin is always happy no matter how sweltering the temperatures get by adding a facial mist to your bag to cool down the face and pump it with hydrating ingredients all day.
