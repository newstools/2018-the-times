Thousands of Capetonians and visitors to the city had a mother of a New Year’s Eve party at the V&A Waterfront. Before midnight people dined out in style or grabbed something to eat from various food trucks. If they didn’t take in one of a number of pop-up entertainment on offer‚ then they danced away the time or took it cool with a jazz performance. The new year came in with a bang – a spectacular fireworks display.
