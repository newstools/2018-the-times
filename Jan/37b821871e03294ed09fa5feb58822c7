The Free State came top in the matric results‚ with the highest number of passes but a closer look at results shows the best quality passes came from the Western Cape. When Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga announced the matric results on Friday‚ she congratulated the Free State province's MEC Tate Mekgoe and his team for their achievement. But‚ according to the Department of Education's examination report‚ also released on Friday‚ Western Cape pupils got the most distinctions. A bachelor pass requires a home language pass of 40%‚ at least 50% for four subjects and at least 30% for two subjects.
