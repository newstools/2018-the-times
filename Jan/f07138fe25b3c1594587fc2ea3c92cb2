A suspect has been arrested for a murder of man on his farm in the Cramond area in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands. Police spokesman Captain Nqobile Gwala refused to divulge the suspect's details‚ but had earlier told media the man was a farmer. "At stage we can't divulge who the suspect is‚” she told TimesLIVE. “The matter is under police investigation." She said the 66-year-old man had gone to a family’s house where a funeral was being held. The suspect asked relatives to leave and an altercation resulted in a fight. It is not clear why he asked mourners to leave. The man believed to be a farmer apparently opened fire and killed a 42-year-old who had "tried to intervene in the fight". The suspect is in "behind bars"‚ Gwala said.
