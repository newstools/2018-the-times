Coffee craving: An espresso pulled by Guy Chaston at The Village Roast in Noordhoek. Breakfast: The Whole Earth Cafe in Scarborough, love that place for lunch as well - simple honest and delicious! I also love Four & Twenty Café in Wynberg and The Short Market Club. After-shift hangout: Hmmm, I don't do much of that anymore but I do love House of Machines and Café Roux in Cape Town. Favourite take out: Pizza, but there aren't any amazing ones in the deep south - maybe that's something I should do! Coffee craving: Love Toys at 44 Stanley. At the moment it is the classic green 1L Stanley filled with espresso and milk. Throughout the day, I would drink out of the little cup as if on a camping holiday. Breakfast: Breakfast is around 11am at work. A huge bowl of noodles or fried rice is the norm. My husband Colin sometimes cooks 15min boiled eggs for me as a treat. After-shift hangout: Melville's Hell's Kitchen where a plate of hot wings and a few cold draught beers often turn a middle-aged woman into a toe-tapping animal. Favourite take out: Denning Vleis at District 6 at Emmarentia. Coffee craving: If I've got a serious coffee craving, I come to Gemelli where we stock Manaka Coffee. Not only are they a growing local brand like us, but the coffee is delicious! Breakfast: My favourite breakfast spot is the new Naked Coffee in Morningside. It's owned by a friend, all the more reason for me to show support, plus they make an out-of-this-world banana bread. After-shift hangout: If I'm not working, I'll stop by Asanka on my way home for a drink. It's a lovely, spacious spot in Rivonia. Favourite takeout: Without a doubt, Nando's! I have all my nearest branches' phone numbers saved on my phone!
