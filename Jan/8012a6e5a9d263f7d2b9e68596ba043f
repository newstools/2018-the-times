Durban metro police on Saturday said reports of rocks being thrown at cars in the city were false. Police spokesman Senior Superintendent Parboo Sewpersad said a tweet by anti-crime activist and founder of MakeSASafe Yusuf Abramjee claiming that rocks were being thrown from the pedestrian bridge between Musgrave Road and Tollgate Bridge was incorrect. Abramjee had also posted a photograph of car windscreen apparently shattered by the rock. "All I can say is don’t mislead the public. If you want to give out information‚ it must be factual‚" Sewpersad said. Reports of rocks being thrown at vehicles in KwaZulu-Natal surfaced after Amina Haffeejee and her brother‚ Abdur Raheem‚ were killed when a rock was thrown from a highway overpass on the N2 near Tongaat on December 27.
