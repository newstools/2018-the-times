Police fired rubber bullets and teargas at protesting residents who had shut down parts of Krugersdorp on Monday morning. The protest action comes after a poster was circulated at the weekend‚ calling on residents to ditch work and school. The latest action comes after several properties‚ alleged to belong to foreign drug lords and brothels‚ were torched last week.
