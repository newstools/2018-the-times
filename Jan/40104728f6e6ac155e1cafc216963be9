My mantra is “confuse the devil”. The last time I cried was a month ago. It was my first time crying in front of myboyfriend. My favourite indulgence is anything sweet. My favourite city is Paris. My favourite drink is Moët & Chandon Imperial Nectar. Not just any champagne. Growing up, I wanted to be a medical doctor because it sounded cool. My top workout tip is planks. The biggest hair sin is colouring your hair. I do it every two weeks. My favourite cheat meal is curry… all that fat! The best part about being Somizi is that I am loved and it shows. I was blessed with an amazing aura and energy, and I know it. It’s so nice to walk into a room and make people happy and that for me is the beauty of being Somizi. • This article was originally published in SMag, a magazine available with the Sowetan newspaper.
