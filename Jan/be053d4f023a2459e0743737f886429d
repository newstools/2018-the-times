Hollywood is hardly a big fan of Donald Trump, but on the upcoming reboot of "Roseanne," the title character will be a supporter of the Republican president.  The award-winning 1990s sitcom is returning to the ABC network in March, and actress Roseanne Barr says her choice to depict her working-class character as pro-Trump is "realistic." "I've always tried to have (the show) be a true reflection of the society we live in," Barr said Monday. "I feel like half the people voted for Trump and half didn't, so it's just realistic," she told journalists at the Television Critics Association winter press tour. "And, in fact, it was working-class people who elected Trump, so I felt like that was very real and something that needed to be discussed," she said. Asked about her own support for Trump, Barr said: "I think it was time for us as a country to shake things up and, you know, try something different." "Roseanne," which ran on ABC from 1988 to 1997, featured Barr as the outspoken mother of four children in a blue-collar family.
