Both President Jacob Zuma and NPA head Shaun Abrahams could soon be without jobs.ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa is this week expected to ramp up his bid to remove them from their positions. Ramaphosa has emerged as the key instigator behind Zuma's annoucement this week of a state capture commission, and the issue of "leadership transition" - the term used in the ANC to describe Zuma’s removal and Ramaphosa’s installation as president of the country - will be discussed at a meeting of the party's national executive committee starting on Thursday.
