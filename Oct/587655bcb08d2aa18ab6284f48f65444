Western Cape police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said that a 17-year-old youth had been arrested on Athburg Walk‚ Hanover Park by members of the Anti-Gang Unit on Saturday morning.

Potelwa said that on Thursday morning two suspects had been arrested in Netreg for possession of unlicensed firearms following a shooting in the area where suspects had earlier sped off in a Mini Cooper hi jacked in Milnerton. In the same operation in Athburg Walk where the second suspect in the Noordien case had been apprehended‚ seven other wanted suspects had been arrested by the unit for an array of crimes including robbery‚ theft and possession of drugs. They will appear in court soon‚ Potelwa said. “Operations by the unit led by Major-General Andre Lincoln are set to continue in other areas as dictated by crime patterns and trends.
