Fans of the television talk show Dr. Phil, named after its popular psychologist host, were not prepared for Treasure Richards and what she had to say when she was a guest on the show last week. The 16-year-old stunned the audience when she explained that although she was born black, she identified as a white person and could not relate to "thug and criminal" African-Americans. A life coach on the show suggested that Treasure is struggling with an identity crisis. During the interview with Dr Phil, Treasure explained: "I know I'm a Caucasian because when I wake up in the morning, I just have such a great life. My hair is so perfect. my skin is not ugly and I'm not fat, which is also a really African-American thing. So, like, I'm just nowhere near like them." Treasure's mother Monique and her brother Kendal said they wrote to Dr Phil hoping his psychological expertise would help Treasure deal with her hatred of black people. Dr Phil's audience struggled to contain their shock as Treasure went on to say that it felt good to put black people down. "I identify with the Ku Klux Klan because the way they believe is just so smart. White is right." Social media went into overdrive, with one Twitter user even disowning Treasure "on behalf of the African American community." But it didn't end there. On Sunday, Treasure's sister Nina posted a YouTube video claiming that Treasure was not the racist she keeps insisting she is. Nina accused her sister of being an attention seeker. "She knows the race topic is a sensitive one that will get a rise out of people." Nina was also interviewed by Tasha K onÂ  Unwine with Tasha K. When asked if there was any truth to the story, Nina responded: "That story is 100% false." Nina says, contrary to what their mother told Dr.Phil about Treasure being racist from a young age, "race was never a factor in their home." Social media blamed Dr Phil and his production team for not vetting the family and their story before inviting them to the show.
