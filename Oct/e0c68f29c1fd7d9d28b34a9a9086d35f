Johannesburg Pride was held on Saturday, in Melrose Arch, and the outfits did not disappoint. "It's all about diversity," said one participant who was dressed as a witchdoctor. Another, dressed in an all-white outfit, joked "I'm a virgin, so I was going for pure and angelic." Some even marched with their dogs. "Even though he's a boy, he's wearing ribbons," said the dog's owner.
