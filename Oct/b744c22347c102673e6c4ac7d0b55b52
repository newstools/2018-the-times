This judge shrugged off his robe and gave chase as two men tried to make a run for it during a court appearance in Washington state. In the video, the men can be seen fleeing the courtroom with the judge soon giving chase. He follows them down three flights of stairs and 'bear hugs' one of the suspects as he tries to leave the building.  Police arrested the second suspect a couple blocks away. The Daily Chronicle reported that both men face a felony charge of second-degree escape and have been placed on bonds. Sheriff Rob Snaza said incidents like this happened rarely. He added that security measures and quick communication made deputies aware of the incident quickly. The only deputy in the room did not give chase because he had two other inmates in his care.
