After months of Zodwa Wabantu flaunting her love with a guy we've only known as a banker and a "Ben 10" up until now, we finally have some info on him. And his name is Ntobeko Linda. Ntobeko, who has just been the guy "brave enough to date Zodwa Wantu" up to this point is finally ready to share who he is with Mzansi. Speaking to Drum, he also shared how they first met and made it clear that he has no F's to give about being called Ben 10. "We started off as friends. It's not like I went up to her and said 'I love you'. "Understanding knows no age. People can call me a Ben 10, I really don't care. I'm not going to confront them. As long as Zodwa doesn't call me a Ben 10, I'm fine," he said. Here are five need-to-know facts about Ntobeko that we picked out for your convenience. You know, just in case during the next 30 Seconds game you take out a card with Zodwa's name on it. Speaking to TshisaLIVE, Zodwa has opened up about her love life and how Ntobeko makes her happy. She explained that she was happy that she never felt like she had to choose between him and her many gigs because he was an understanding boyfriend. "I'm happy because he always waits for me. I know that he's a fine man and that he wouldn't actually struggle to find a less busy girlfriend or even just anyone else but he waits for me. Like now, I was in Dubai and my male colleagues, like the people I work with like Naakmusiq and them, they could make any man insecure but not him. He knows I'll always come back to him as long as he's waiting for me." #LoveLivesHere
