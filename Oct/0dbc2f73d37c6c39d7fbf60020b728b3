Everyone knows that being in the spotlight isn't a walk in the park. Apart from being under public scrutiny some celebs go through the most with fans. During a Twitter discussion about the most bizarre Uber experiences, Anele Mdoda revealed that an Uber driver got really agitated with her because he wanted a selfie with her, but she logged her name as Zintathu. Imagine! But that wasn't the only experience she had. While in Durban a Taxify driver asked them to get out because they apparently requested an Uber and he wasn't. Mara this world...how bizarre?
