The ANC and the SACPâ€™s bid to have Siyabonga Gama appointed CEO of Transnet in 2009, despite a cloud of allegations over his head and against the wishes of the board, will come under scrutiny at the Zondo commission. ANC chair Gwede Mantashe and SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande are among those called to the state capture commission to respond to explosive claims that former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan will make of political interference in the management and appointments at state-owned enterprises.

She is due to testify on November 12. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
