“She is just acting stupid!” a caregiver at a Randburg crèche for disabled children snarls, as she hits a young girl in the face with a backpack. A nurse employed by the crèche in Jukskei Park, north of Johannesburg, and owned by a medical doctor, said she filmed the abuse by the caregiver because she could no longer watch the children being hurt. The doctor, meanwhile, has expressed horror at the incident.
