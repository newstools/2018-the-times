The Economic Freedom Fighters will not suspend its deputy president‚ Floyd Shivambu‚ pending an inquiry into allegations related to the looting of VBS Mutual Bank. “I am aware that my brother’s name has been raised in relation to this matter. I am a private businessman and I do not intend to involve myself or my family in political debates‚” he added. The EFF said in a statement on Wednesday that “all who are responsible and illegally benefited from the fraud must be criminally prosecuted immediately” and “blacklisted”. The statement did not comment on the Shivambu brothers.
