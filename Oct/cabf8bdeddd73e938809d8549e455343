One person has been airlifted to hospital and two others are in critical condition after an explosion at Eagle Ford dealership in Bramleyâ€š in the north of Johannesburg. Chief operating officer at Emer-G-Med Jurgen Kotze said two other people were moderately injured in the car dealership's workshop on Wednesday morning. According to Kotze the explosion was caused by an oxyacetylene torch. The injured were taken to dedicated burns facilities at Netcare Union Hospital and Netcare Milpark hospital. Details of the blast were not immediately known and Eagle Ford spokespeople were unable to comment on Wednesday morning. Oxyacetylene welding or oxy-fuel welding uses fuel gases and oxygen to weld and cut metals.
