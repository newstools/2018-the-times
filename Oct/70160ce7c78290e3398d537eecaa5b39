Mboweni made his maiden appearance before parliament's standing committee on finance on Tuesday as part of a delegation to discuss the annual reports of the Treasury and Sars.

Mboweni said it was clear that regulatory authorities had been let down by both internal and external auditors who turned a blind eye to the looting spree‚ which affected several poor municipalities and the elderly who had deposited their savings in the doomed bank. A forensic report released last week‚ titled The Great Bank Heist‚ detailed how the bulk of the stolen funds‚ close to R2bn‚ allegedly benefited individuals and entities related to VBS executives‚ including its largest purported shareholder‚ Vele Investments.
