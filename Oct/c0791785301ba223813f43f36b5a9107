Dan Plato, the DA’s choice for mayor of Cape Town, may have to wait a bit longer to wear the mayoral chain, with incumbent Patricia de Lille set to launch another court challenge in the intensifying  battle between the mayor and her party. De Lille has refused to discuss the details of her case, telling the Sunday Times only that she would challenge the “procedural errors” in this week’s council sitting, when a report that recommended she be criminally charged was tabled. She said she wanted the court to rule on the matter before Wednesday, the day she previously undertook to hand over the baton to Plato. The court challenge comes as speculation is rife about her next political move, with some insiders claiming she may stay on as mayor even though she announced her intention to go two months ago after a deal was reached with the party. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said he appreciated De Lille was in a fight for her “political reputation”, but the matter was now between her and the law firm that produced the report, Bowmans. Maimane, however,  said De Lille’s resignation stood. “You can’t sustain that argument because it’s the party that sent her there. If she chooses to say she won’t resign from council, then the council would have to take action against her,” said Maimane. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
