It took five years‚ 80 designers‚ more than 800 workers and R240m in wages to construct one of South Africa’s engineering marvels: the Mount Edgecombe interchange‚ north of Durban. On Tuesday morning major routes leading from the R1.1bn interchange were closed to allow for the official opening by transport minister Blade Nzimande‚ who described the interchange as a “veritable civil engineering work of art”. The South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) was awarded the contract for upgrading the old intersection of the N2 and M41 to ease traffic congestion‚ due to the expansion of the La Lucia Ridge and Umhlanga areas. According to Sanral an additional 40‚000 vehicles were entering and leaving the N2 from the M41 daily‚ resulting in “substantial queuing of vehicles during the day”. Two incrementally launched bridges are part of the interchange upgrade. One bridge is 948m long - the longest bridge of its kind in South Africa - while the other is 440m long. A pedestrian bridge has also been constructed over the N2 to ensure the safety of those on foot. Lighting has been installed to ensure that the entire interchange is lit at night for increased safety. Resident engineer Henk Kaal said although there was scepticism about the project ever being completed‚ motorists were now beginning to enjoy the improved flow of traffic.
