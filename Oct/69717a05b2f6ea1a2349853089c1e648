Zoleka Ngwenyeni was a teenager looking forward to an appointment with a hairdresser when she last spoke to her mother. Instead of being able to show off her new hairstyle to friends and family‚ she was raped and murdered. The 16-year-old girl’s body was found in Meyerton on Wednesday by a passer-by who had stepped into a stretch of veld to relieve himself. The man then contacted the police. “The girl was found partly naked and used condoms together with tissues were found next to her body‚” said captain Fikile Funda. Funda said the girl had scratches on her neck and a big open wound on the back of her head. He could not say when she could have been killed. “We will wait for post-mortem results to tell us when she was killed. At this stage we can’t speculate‚” Funda said. He said no arrests have been made so far and police investigations are currently ongoing. “We are interviewing people who last saw her and gathering all information that can help our investigation‚” Funda said. He further revealed that Ngwenyeni was last seen on Monday at about 11am. She had told her mother that she was going to a salon not too far from her home‚ to fix her hair. The 16-year-old girl was not immediately reported missing as the parents had told the police that she sometimes slept over at a family member’s home.
