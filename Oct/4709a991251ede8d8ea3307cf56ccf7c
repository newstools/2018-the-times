If there's one thing that most people are willing to agree on these social media streets, it's that AKA always gives stellar performances and often leaves it all on the stage, no matter how big or small it is and his live sessions were no different! The Fela In Versace rapper held nothing back, not his swag or auto-tune in his performance that left Twitter in good spirits and shot up the trends list. AKA performed Touch My Blood, Beyonce and Don't Forget To Pray among his many hit tracks. AKA's episode of the JR Feel Good Sessions left fans wanting more and they sangÂ  the guys's praise. In case you missed it, lucky for you JR's got your back!
