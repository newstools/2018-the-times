There has been no word on the whereabouts of Leon Orsmond‚ a SA advertising executive who disappeared in Kigali‚ Rwanda‚ in February. This week‚ a Facebook page titled “Find Leon Osborn” emerged asking why the Rwandan national police were not responding to questions about Orsmond’s disappearance from his home in Kigali. The post also mentioned that the Rwandan national police last tweeted in March about Orsmond’s disappearance when they sought information from the public. On Wednesday‚ department of international relations and cooperation spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mabaya said Orsmond had disappeared and Rwandan authorities did not know where he was. “In Rwanda‚ the Rwandan police have put notices looking for him. As we sit now‚ this is an open case and we do not know where he is‚” Mabaya said.
