When you know how to have a good time... you know! And there's no doubt that Khanyi Mbau and Tebogo Lerole sure know how turn a situation into a lituation. Tebogo posted a throwback video of a "wild" weekend they had and all we can say is, with Dezemba fast approaching you need to take notes. In fact, it looks like the kind of situation where they had come back from a hectic party. Guys there's a whole iron (for the weave) and ironing board (used as a table for the dranks)... like legendary stuff!Â Their dance moves were also so litty man! Also, side note: How cute are the matchy-matchy vibes between Khanyi and Tebobo? Remember to swipe left... believe us, you want to see all the videos!
