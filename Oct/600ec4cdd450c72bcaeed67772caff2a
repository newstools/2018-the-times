Actor Khulu Skenjana has penned the sweetest letter to his wife and actess, Mona. After years of wedded bliss, Khulu isn't shy to gush over his gal on social media. In his latest post he thanked Mona for being his pillar of strength. "Thank you for never compromising yourself. Loving me when I had difficulty loving myself, calling me out on my nonsense so that I may realise my great Godly potential. Today I stand proud, confident and free. Now we soar on high my darling." Swoon!
