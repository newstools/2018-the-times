Even though they've had their differences in the past, the life lessons that Cassper Nyovest learnt from HHP will remain with him forever. When Cassper took to the stage at Bassline on Tuesday afternoon to pay tribute to his "big brother" he had the crowd in laughter as he remembered how HHP humbled him. Cassper recalled how during a performance in Maftown, HHP pulled off his sunglasses and schooled him about acting like a superstar in ikasi. "That moment lived with me. I have to keep humbling myself and living by some of the things I learnt from Jabba." The Doc Shebeleza star took a trip down memory lane and revealed how HHP would pay him for being his 'hype man'. "Jabba used to pay me for every show just to hype him up. That's how I got a source of income at that time." Cassper said that HHP believed he could one day be as big as Lil Wayne. "My biggest dream at that point was to be signed to Jabba and he would always tell me at that point that I'm not an artist you should be signed, I could be a businessman. He would say that I could be as big as Lil Wayne and I would be like, 'This guy is so crazy I'm hungry and I just want to release this album.'" Other musicians including Shugasmakx and DJ Fresh who all spoke fondly about HHP's selfless nature. HHP died in a suspected suicide on October 24 at his home in Randpark Ridge. The Bosso hitmaker will be honoured with a second memorial service in Mahikeng on Thursday and will be laid to rest on Saturday. READ MORE:
