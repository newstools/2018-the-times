The ex-wife of the so-called “Springs Monster”, who terrorised and abused their five children for years, is “not a bad woman”, her new fiancé told Times Select on Wednesday. Jan Coetzee, who is also a cousin of the “Springs Monster”, spoke excitedly about the life ahead of them now that sentencing has been handed down. She escaped with a five-year suspended sentence. And while he described her as “wonderful” and “everything I want in a woman”, her ex-husband, who has been jailed for 35 years, has also found new love – in prison.
