The families of three prisoners who attacked a warder at a maximum security prison say the inmates have been refused outside medical treatment after “force” had to be used to contain the situation. After the warder was overpowered, “necessary force had to be used” to contain the situation, says Eastern Cape correctional services spokesperson Nobuntu Gantana.
