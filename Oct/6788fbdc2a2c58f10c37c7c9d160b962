It has been a bittersweet afternoon for those close to HHP as his life and the impact he made through his music was celebrated at a memorial service on Tuesday. Bassline in Johannesburg was filled to capacity as fans traveled from across the city to pay their respects to the Bosso hitmaker. HHP's friends and family shared fond memories of how HHP was a selfless person who touched many people with his larger than life personality. Fellow musicians including Shugasmakx, DJ Fresh and Cassper Nyovest spoke about how HHP's legacy lives on not just in his own music, but through the music of all the artists' he helped along the way. Cassper fondly remembered how HHP believed in him right from the start and when he didn't have an income would pay him to be his 'hype man.' There was also fitting musical tributes including a performance of HHP's hit track Harambe which had his partner, Lerato Sengadi sobbing. Lerato described HHP as her soulmate and promised to protect his legacy as fiercely in death as she did when he was alive. HHP died in a suspected suicide on October 24 and will be laid to rest in his hometown of Mahikeng on Saturday.
