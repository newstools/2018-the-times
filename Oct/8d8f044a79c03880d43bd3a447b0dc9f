A man has been arrested in connection with the murder of Westbury mother, Heather Petersen, and the shooting of her niece. Police officers, following up on information, arrested the man at a house in Krugersdorp on Sunday afternoon. Petersen was shot dead last month when she and her niece were caught the crossfire between rival gangsters while they were walking home. Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubela in a statement said the arrest was made while officers were carrying out an intelligence driven operation. He said the 32-year-old man had been arrested at a Krugersdorp house after police received information from Westbury community members as to his whereabouts. “The suspect is due to appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court soon,” Makhubela said.
