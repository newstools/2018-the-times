Police minister Bheki Cele visited the University of Zululand on September 18 2018, after a violent incident involving two roommates, during which one was fatally stabbed. Cele also had strong words for students who take the law into their own hands. A video of the student who is alleged to have stabbed first-year student Sazi Ngubo being viciously attacked by other students went viral. “Those who practice vigilantism‚ including on this campus‚ the law will have to take its course on them”.
