HHP's partner and well-known publicist Lerato Sengadi struggled to fight back tears as she took to the stage at Bassline in Johannesburg where his life is being celebrated. HHP died on October 24 in a suspected suicide after a lengthy battle with depression. "I've lost my husband, my best friend, my comedian. Motheo waka. I loved you when you didn't love yourself, I loved you when you thought you didn't deserve to be loved, I loved you through the happiness and pain, the highs and lows and the darkness and pride. I find solace in that even in your very, very last breath you knew that," she said. Lerato poured her heart out about the bond they shared and was applauded when she vowed to protect HHP's legacy. "Our love is one written about in novels, written about in songs and acted out in movies. It is a love that people can only dream about. So I know for sure God does not make mistakes. I will continue to be strong for you now and protect your legacy like I did when you were alive.Â  There will still be so much said but I will take those lashings with the strength and grace of the warrior queen you chose to share your life with." She ended off her heartfelt tribute by promising to meet HHP in the next life. "The pain is gone now my king. I will see you in the next life time."
