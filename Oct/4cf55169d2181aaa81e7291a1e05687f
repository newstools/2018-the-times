Treat your partner or best friend to a movie night courtesy of TimesLIVE at a special screening of new action-thriller Peppermint before it hits the cinemas. Jennifer Garner plays a young mother, Riley North, who awakens from a coma after her husband and daughter are killed in a brutal attack on the family. When the system frustratingly shields the murderers from justice, Riley sets out to transform herself from citizen to urban guerrilla. Channelling her frustration into personal motivation, she spends years in hiding honing her mind, body and spirit to become an unstoppable force – eluding the underworld, the police and the FBI - as she methodically delivers her personal brand of justice. Peppermint will be in cinemas from 26 October. We're giving away 29 double tickets to a screening in Johannesburg, and 40 double tickets to a screening in Cape Town. When: Tuesday October 23 Time: 7pm for 8pm Venue:  Nu Metro Cinema in Hyde Park, Johannesburg  and the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town. To stand a chance to win, all you have to do is email events@empire-ent.africa with the title Peppermint in the subject line, before 12pm on Friday October 19. Please also indicate whether you want to join the screening in Johannesburg or Cape Town.
