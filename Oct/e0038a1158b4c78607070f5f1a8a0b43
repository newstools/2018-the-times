A letter penned by radio and TV personality Redi Thlabi slamming the author and publishers of a controversial new book about Winnie Mandela has gone viral. The book, Truth, lies and alibis, lists quotes on the back of the book by Thlabi, Sisonke Msimang, Palesa Morudu and Aubrey Matshiqi. "Winnie was a women of her times, there was a war and she too was a soldier," reads the quote from Thlabi on the back of the book. In the letter, Thlabi said her quote was taken from an article that she had written for Sunday Times and would be interpreted by readers as a "shout-out" for the book. Her full letter was published on The Reading List, apparently with her approval. Thlabi said she was appalled and knew she had not been contacted as the contents of the book by Fred Bridgland are the "antithesis of what I believe and the complexity of when I embrace historical figures." "I am appalled. How dare you! How dare you Tafelberg. You have been conniving and dishonest. You knew where to find me. Why didn't you do it?" she wrote in the letter published on The Reading List. Tafelberg did not respond to TimesLIVE at the time of publishing this article. City Press tweeted a picture of a response, purportedly from the publisher. Morudu tweeted her anger about this issue last week.
