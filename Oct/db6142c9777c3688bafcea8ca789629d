Nomzamo Mbatha had a spicy clapback ready when a tweep dragged her over cheating rumours. The actress was minding her own business when the troll rolled onto her Twitter page and questioned her about apparently getting "dumped". Nomzamo hit back with class yet a whole lot of spice in a now deleted tweet. "I think people are allowed to do what they want to do, we all have freedom of choice. However, it is NEVER an invalidation of who I am and what I have to offer in this life. Still winning?" Maps also slammed the tweep with a stinging clapback. As reported by TshisaLIVE in May, Nomzamo and Maps split after cheating rumours involving Maps came to light. "The cheating rumours are nothing new but Nomzamo got proof that couldn't be disputed. She's upset. She didn't expect thisâ€š" an insider told TshisaLIVE at the time. Maps' management denied the allegations, while Nomzamo's team refused to comment on her private life.
