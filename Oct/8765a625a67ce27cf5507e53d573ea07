On Friday‚ Ugandan runner Joshua Cheptegei promised to cover 10km through the Durban CBD in 27 minutes and 20 seconds. And on Sunday he exceeded that promise‚ smashing the FNB Durban 10K CitySurfRun in 27:16 - the fastest 10km ever run on South African soil (beating his own record from the same race almost exactly a year ago). Swiss Julien Wanders finished in second‚ 16 seconds behind‚ in a time of 27:32. Moses Koech of Kenya finished third in 27:46. The best-placed South African was Stephen Mokoka‚ who - just three weeks after wining the Cape Town Marathon - came in sixth place more than a minute behind Cheptegei‚ in a time of 28:18.
