Not all criminals make a quick getaway – as this footage from a Manuel Antonio‚ Costa Rica‚ café demonstrates. According to the Daily Mail‚ while El Patio de Café Milagro often plays host to a sloth around the back‚ this is the first time one of the creatures decided to come in for a midnight snack. The sloth’s slow and steady approach unfortunately failed to nab it the meal it was looking for – as it fell of a chair with a thud that summoned the café’s owners‚ who relocated it to its favourite guaramo tree.
