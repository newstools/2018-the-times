An oval-shaped face is the most versatile to work with so focus on choosing a frame that is proportionate and balanced on your face. Choose frames that are angular with a rectangular or geometric shape to make a round face appear longer and thinner. If you have a strong jaw line and a broad forehead, choose sunglasses that are narrow with soft curves like cat-eye or round frames Aviator and cat-eye frames are best suited to people with an "inverted triangle" face shape - a wide forehead and narrow chin.
