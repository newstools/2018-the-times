If South Africa held a general election tomorrow‚ which party would you vote for? That was the question I asked in a Twitter poll nine months ago. The options‚ limited to four by the poll’s format‚ were the ANC‚ the DA‚ the EFF and‚ somewhat stupidly‚ “Wouldn’t vote”. In retrospect I should have gone with “None of the above” rather than “Wouldn’t vote”‚ but‚ in my defence‚ this was never going to be an authoritative taking of the nation’s temperature: I’m a spinner of yarns‚ not a cruncher of numbers.
