EFF leader Julius Malema‚ commenting on the announcement that the state of the nation address (Sona) has been postponed‚ says President Jacob Zuma's resignation is imminent. Malema said a majority of the ANC national working committee members who met on Monday "spoke in favor of his removal". Parliamentary presiding officers Baleka Mbete and Thandi Modise on Tuesday afternoon announced the postponement of the Sona, which was due to take place on Thursday. Mbete said: "We've decided to approach the president of the republic to postpone the state of the nation address. "We need to create room for establishing a much more conducive atmosphere in Parliament." This comes after opposition parties requested that the speech, which President Jacob Zuma was scheduled to deliver on Thursday, be postponed until after a no-confidence vote on Zuma’s leadership. Facing a no-confidence motion in Parliament set for February 22, Zuma has survived several attempts to oust him in the past. But this time around a significant part of the ANC wants him to step down well before his second term ends mid next year. The ANC has called a special meeting of its decision-making National Executive Committee (NEC) for Wednesday, at which analysts have said some members of the party could call for Zuma to resign. Mbete has said that a new date for the state of the nation address will be announced shortly.
