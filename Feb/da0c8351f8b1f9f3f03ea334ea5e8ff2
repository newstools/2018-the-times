A request from opposition parties to postpone the president’s state of the nation address “is receiving consideration“, the parliament’s speaker Baleka Mbete said in a letter to the country’s main opposition party. Opposition parties want the state of the nation speech, which President Jacob Zuma is scheduled to deliver on Thursday, postponed until after a no-confidence vote on Zuma’s leadership. The speaker of parliament has scheduled the no-confidence vote for February 22. - Reuters
