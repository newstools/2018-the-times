Parliament’s speaker Baleka Mbete announced on Tuesday that the state of the nation address has been postponed. Mbete said: "We've decided to approach the president of the republic to postpone the state of the nation address. "We need to create room for establishing a much more conducive atmosphere in Parliament." This comes after opposition parties requested that the speech, which President Jacob Zuma was scheduled to deliver on Thursday, be postponed until after a no-confidence vote on Zuma’s leadership. The speaker of parliament has scheduled the no-confidence vote for February 22. Zuma, whose presidency has been marred by graft scandals and economic decline, has been in a weakened position since he was replaced as leader of the ANC by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa in December. The ANC has called a special meeting of its decision-making National Executive Committee (NEC) for Wednesday, at which analysts have said some members of the party could call for Zuma to resign. Mbete has said that a new date for the state of the nation address will be announced shortly. EFF leader Julius Malema‚ commenting on the postponement, predicted that Zuma's resignation was imminent.
