The government guaranteed facility will form part of the financing of Eskom’s current capital expenditure programme‚ the utility said in a statement. The terms of the facility are comparable to Eskom’s existing facility agreements and pricing is aligned to market benchmarks of similar structures‚ it added. Eskom’s Interim Group Chief Executive Phakamani Hadebe said: “We view the successful execution of this facility as a demonstration of the financial markets’ confidence in Eskom’s turn-around strategy. “We are cognisant of the challenges that are still ahead for the business and we are committed to ensuring that we expediently transition Eskom’s operational and financial profile to adequate standards. Eskom remains a critical enabler for South Africa’s economic growth and it is critical that we attain maximum operational efficiency for the business to avoid negatively impacting the macro-environment”.
