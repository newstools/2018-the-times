Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba presented the annual budget speech in Parliament on Wednesday, and with it the inevitable hike in taxes. Gigaba announced an increase of 1 percentage point in the value-added tax rate in the 2018 budget, raising it to 15%. The tax hikes are part of a package of measures to raise an additional R36-billion in light of a revenue gap of R48.2-billion in the current year. But do you know what your taxes are paying for?
