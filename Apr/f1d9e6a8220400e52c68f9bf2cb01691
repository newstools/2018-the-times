The future is not looking bright for the ANC, a situation that opens the doors for the opposition. Drawn guns, flared tempers and several protest marches to the ANC offices in Durban in recent weeks point to a state of vulnerability for the ruling party in its traditional stronghold of KwaZulu-Natal. At the heart of the instability is the imminent disbandment of a provincial interim task team set up earlier this year when the provincial executive committee was suspended in January. The team was established to quell fighting between factions. One group is aligned to President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s emissary, former KZN premier Senzo Mchunu, while the other supports former provincial chair Sihle Zikalala, who backs former president Jacob Zuma and former presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
