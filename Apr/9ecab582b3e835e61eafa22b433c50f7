Just when we thought we had seen it all when it comes to dating shows, Mzansi Magic's new speed dating series had us wanting to trade in our IDs and leave Mzansi. We know that some people have a list of requirements for bae like... *Scribble* *scribble* must have good looks *Scribble* *scribble* must have a steady income *Scribble* *scribble* must like me! But did you ever think, in your wildest dreams, that on that list must be a nyana clause reading: "must have tall, dark hair". It was just one of the deal breakers that came to light when Perfect Match premiered on TV this week. The show gives a group of singles onlyÂ two minutes to impress their potential bae, before sealing the deal with a kiss. Fans were shooketh beyond belief at the request and shared their reactions to some of the craziest moments from the show on social media. Check out some of the highlights: Meanwhile, we're just out here wondering where we can get Six's digits.
