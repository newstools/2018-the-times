The ANC has called on citizens to join them in a night vigil on Friday night to honour Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. It will take place at the Orlando Community Hall from 8pm and will also be attended by ANC leaders. "This marks the final activity of the 10-day mourning period as part of celebrating the iconic life of Mama Winnie‚" said party spokesman Pule Mabe. "The African National Congress urges its members and the general public to attend and participate in the night vigil as part of giving this stalwart of our liberation struggle a befitting a send-off." In addition‚ 600 busses from all around Gauteng have been laid on to provide transport to Madikizela-Mandela's funeral on Saturday from 8am at the Orlando Stadium. "Busses will depart from various townships from 04:30am‚" said Mabe. Madikizela-Mandela‚ who died last week Monday‚ will be buried at the Fourways Memorial Park. The 81-year-old died after a lengthy illness which saw her in and out of hospital since the start of the year.
