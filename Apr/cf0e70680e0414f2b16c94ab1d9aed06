The online registration for public schools in Gauteng for the 2019 academic year will open on Monday‚ April 16. This was announced by Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi at the department’s office in Johannesburg on Thursday. He said the system had improved and would be quicker and provide more options for parents making applications for their children. He said that every school pupil needed to be given their own catchment area. “We have modernised the system‚ it will take a parent far less than five minutes‚” Lesufi said. He added that the system would allow parents to apply for a school of their choice or one closer to their home or work‚ or that caters for a specific technical field.
