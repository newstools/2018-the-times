When veteran actor Jerry Mofokeng found out that the man who raised him was not his biological father, he was left heartbroken. Jerry reflected on the life-changing experience during an interview on Kaya FM earlier this week. The seasoned actor told Bridget Masinga how the news was sprung onto him in a Woolworths store in the Free State. Jerry described how he went to the store to buy a few items when he was stopped by a group of women for selfies. There was one lady from the group who kept her distance and eventually she approached him. "There’s this lady standing a distance away and she keeps smiling. And she keeps smiling. Kind of nervously smiling. And when they go away, she comes in and says ‘dumela ngoaneso, hello my brother,’ and I said ‘hello my sister.' And she said ‘no Jerry, I said hello my brother,’ and I said ‘yeah, I heard you’ and she said ‘Jerry! Listen to me… you are my brother’ and I said ‘yeah, yeah, yeah’ and she said ‘woah, Jerry, my father is your father’ and I said ‘what do you mean?’" Jerry added that the lady asked him if he knew a man named Dan Motlepo Makgetha, who used to visit their house. "I said ‘I know him! He used to drink at my home!’ and she said ‘that’s your father’ and that was the beginning of my journey." The actor also revealed that he plans to turn his life story into a documentary soon.
