A restaurant in America is taking culinary experiences to a new level - it's adding tarantulas as a topping on its burgers. Bull City Burger and Brewery in Durham, North Carolina, is offering customers a lightly salted and oven baked tarantula on top of its traditional beef patties, according to the Mirror. Guests hoping to try the creature must enter a $30 (R361) 'tarantula raffle'. Anyone who polishes off the dish gets a t-shirt. There are only 18 zebra tarantulas available. The hair-raising meal is part of Bull City Burger's exotic meat month. They have a range of burgers made from exotic meat such as alligator, iguana, python, turtle, and various insects.
