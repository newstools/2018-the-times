The North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria was packed to capacity on Monday with members of an Eastern Cape community who are resisting a foreign company to mine on their land. The community of Xolobeni village is demanding the court grant a ruling that the Department of Mineral Resources cannot issue mining rights without their consent. The court is expected to hear arguments from lawyers within the next three days. The outcome of the case could end in a landmark ruling giving rural communities powers to refuse companies to extract minerals from their land. In 2007 residents formed the Amadiba Crisis Committee to stop Australian mining conglomerate Mineral Resources Commodities to mine titanium. They have argued that mining would result in the mass displacement of households and destruction of their way of life. The community depends on fishing and farming in order to survive.
