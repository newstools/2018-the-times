A security guard was killed and a civilian injured in the shoot-out between police and five armed men in the East Rand Mall in Boksburg on Friday afternoon. Police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo said the police received a tip-off that a suspect they sought for a murder in Carletonville earlier this year would be at the mall on Friday at about midday. Police officers approached the suspect in the passage before the armed men opened fire on the police. A woman caught in the crossfire was hit in the lower part of her body and taken to hospital. One security guard was shot dead in his attempt to help the police with their arrest. The murder suspect was arrested. A suspect‚ shot in his upper body by police‚ was taken to the hospital under police guard. The three other men escaped. Masondo said he could give more information about the murder in Carltonville earlier this year‚ because other suspects sought for the murder are still at large.
