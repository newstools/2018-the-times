Letoya Makhene's bundle of joy is officially six months old. And, to celebrate Letoya organised a special family shoot. Letoya and her six-month-old son, Kopano wore matching traditional outfits. It's super cute. The actress and her boyfriend, Tshepo Leeuw welcomed their first child together in November last year. "We were blessed a month ago today with the newest member in our family. Meet Kopano Jordan Leeuw. Thank you so much for all your love and prayers." Proud mama, Letoya also couldn't stop gushing about her other cubs.
