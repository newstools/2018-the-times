Zahid Begs‚ who community leaders say is from Lenasia‚ was forced to stop close to the Grasmere toll plaza on Friday afternoon. His gold BMW M4 was found abandoned near the highway‚ the keys still in the ignition and with his valuables left inside. A source‚ who assists Bangladeshi‚ Pakistani and Indian nationals in raising awareness about the kidnapping of foreign nationals in South Africa‚ said in a message that the kidnapping happened close to the toll plaza. "His car was found abandoned next to the road." He said that a ransom of half-a-million rand had allegedly been demanded for his release. Police spokesman Captain Mokoena said he was unable to comment on the incident at this stage. The kidnapping of Begs‚ who is of Indian descent‚ follows Wednesday's dramatic rescue of a Pakistani national who was found chained up inside a hidden room in a house in Eldorado Park‚ outside Johannesburg‚ in a police raid. The raid‚ which saw police storming houses across Johannesburg‚ led to the arrest of seven people‚ including Pakistani and Bangladeshi nationals. The seven‚ according to police have been linked to kidnappings of three Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals across Gauteng earlier this month and in March. This is a developing story.
