From see-through numbers to thongs that had the internet comparing her to an elephant, Zodwa has given us the most when she dresses up for the cameras. By now we all know that Zodwa couldn't care less what people think of her outfits and the star has proven it by debuting a number of racy numbers over the last year and a bit. In a recent social media video she told haters that she was not about to argue with them because it's their "opinion mos".
