Dale College Boys’ High School is taking disciplinary action against five pupils who were filmed shoving a screaming pupil‚ head first‚ into a metal drum during a school break. The bullying incident‚ shared widely on social media‚ happened during exams last term at the school in the Eastern Cape. It was only brought to the attention of headmaster Mike Eddy a few days ago‚ the Daily Dispatch reported on Friday. “We will consider all options to deal with this matter as best as we can because we view it as very serious‚” said Eddy. The school hoped to reconcile and rehabilitate the pupils‚ rather than expel the culprits. The Department of Basic Education told Parliament last year that more than one million pupils experienced violence such as bullying‚ corporal punishment or assault at school. Briefing the basic education committee on safety in schools‚ the department’s director for school safety Paseka Njobe said that 22.2% of pupils had experienced a form of violence in schools while 20.9% had experienced it online. Paul Colditz‚ CEO of Fedsas‚ said in March that much of the violence seen in schools was related to what happened at the homes of pupils. “Parents have not taken responsibility for the proper upbringing of their children. That is it. Short and sweet.”
