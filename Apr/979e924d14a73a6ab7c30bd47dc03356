A security guard was killed and another guard and a bystander were injured during a cash-in-transit (CIT) robbery in Klerksdorp on Thursday morning. Hawks spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso said the robbery happened at 11.30am. A truck from G4S Cash Solutions was ambushed after collecting money from Standard Bank on the corner of Kock and OR Tambo Street. The armed robbers‚ who wore overalls and were armed with AK47s‚ R5s and pistols‚ stole an undisclosed amount of cash. “It happened immediately after they just collected the money [from the bank] and they were ambushed.” Rikhotso said the robbers fired shots into the air and forced the two security guards to open the back of the truck before shooting them at close range. One was fatally injured and the second was rushed to hospital. The driver was unharmed. A bystander was also shot during the robbery and taken to hospital. “It happened so quickly‚” Rikhotso said. A video posted on social media shows two robbers using a trolley to move the bag of cash from the G4S truck to their white Toyota double cab bakkie before a third armed robber helps lift it onto the back. In another video on social media a bystander who witnessed the incident says about 50 shots were fired. The Hawks are investigating a case of armed robbery. No arrests have been made.
