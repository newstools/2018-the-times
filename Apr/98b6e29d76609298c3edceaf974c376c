When a graphic designer was commissioned to bring to life the moment Nelson Mandela cast South Africa's first democratic vote‚ Nhlakanipho Mkhize knew his piece had to be "bright and beautiful". "For me‚ this artwork represents freedom‚ beauty and colour. What happened on April 27 1994 gave us life. That's why I used so much colour. Freedom is something that is really beautiful and this piece had to show that‚" said the man from Umbumbulu‚ about 24km inland from Amanzimtoti in KwaZulu-Natal. Mkhize was born a year before Nelson Mandela cast his vote in 1994. "I am not a born-free. But I have enjoyed the freedom so much that I want others to see how beautiful it is‚" he said. Mkhize was commissioned by the Durban Art Gallery. It took four days for Mkhize to create the picture. "I used the technique of using pixels‚ which I basically use in my personal work. I was very interested in fine arts in high school but I was advised by my teacher to do graphic design. So now graphic design has influenced my work and that's why I use the pixels‚" he said. Mkhize hopes that those who view his art work‚ which he expects will be displayed at the Durban Art Gallery‚ will take people back to the country’s first democratic vote. "It was a historic moment. I hope this helps people remember what Freedom Day is really about."
