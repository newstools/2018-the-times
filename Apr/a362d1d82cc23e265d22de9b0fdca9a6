For Julius Malema‚ Christmas arrived on the morning of Thursday the 19th of April. AfriForum’s threat was simple and logical. If the National Prosecuting Authority isn’t going to follow up on Thuli Madonsela’s report that Malema benefited from tenders in Limpopo‚ then somebody else needs to prosecute him. It’s an approach lifted directly from the EFF playbook‚ which hounded Jacob Zuma while the NPA twiddled its thumbs. AfriForum is simply pointing out that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the Commander-In-Chief. At least‚ that’s what it thinks it’s pointing out. But of course AfriForum is not The Avengers‚ an apolitical group of superheroes dedicated to upholding humanity and universal dignity. Instead‚ it is the group that describes apartheid apologist Steve Hofmeyr as a “friend”‚ and‚ last year‚ insisted that Afrikaners should be free to display the old South African flag in private. Just to reiterate: this is an organisation that publicly stands by people who have a sentimental or cultural affection for the official jingle and official flag of a crime against humanity.
