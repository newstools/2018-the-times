As a nationwide bus strike entered its sixth day‚ commuters across the country gritted their teeth to face queues and mayhem. Zanele Sabela‚ a spokesperson for the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union‚ said workers were no longer demanding a 12% wage increase. They are now seeking a 9.5 % increase for the first year and a 9% increase for the second. Commuters took to social media on Monday to vent their frustration.
