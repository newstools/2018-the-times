We can't say we blame Cassper for declaring his love for his manager TLee - the pair have been through the most together. When you find a person that sticks with you from you sexy-chubby nigga days straight to your six-pack beard gang, he's a keeper. In what was inspired by Kanye West's Twitter spree, a Tsibipian raised the possibility of Cassper waking up one day to tell Llee he "can't be managed." But Cassper quickly dismissed the possibility. The rapper explained that his relationship with TLee was more than business. He said Llee was more like blood family for him. "It’s more than business. That’s my big brother," Cassper wrote. He also implied that TLee wasn't like the many other rap brothers who only called themselves big brother so they can abuse or bully him. That middle part sounded like shade. Without naming anyone, all Tsibipians know who used to call himself Cassper's big brother. But ke... a'skholapho. We were tearing up by the time we got the "I love him" part of Cassper's love declaration.
