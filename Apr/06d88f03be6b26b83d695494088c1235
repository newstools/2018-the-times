The ANC Women’s League president‚ Bathabile Dlamini‚ said the organisation will not stop calling for a woman president until it happens in South Africa. Dlamini was delivering a message on behalf of the league at the funeral of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg. Addressing Madikizela-Mandela‚ Dlamini said: “We must confess; we have allowed patriarchy to oppress you.” The ANC Women’s League in the 1990s pushed for Madikizela-Mandela to be elected to the top leadership of the ANC and the country but failed in its attempt. The league’s efforts to have a woman elected at the ANC’s last conference in December 2017 also fell flat. Dlamini said they request that a day be set aside as Winnie Mandela Day to commemorate her life. “Your spirit will live on‚” she said to the deceased leader.
