Ajax Cape Town are running out of games in their bid to avoid becoming the first club in the last eight to finish the season without a single away win. Jomo Cosmos‚ in the 2009-10 season‚ were the last club who went through 15 away games in a season with a single victory - drawing seven and losing eight. Ajax in this campaign have picked up just three points away from home‚ losing 10 of 13 games on the road and drawing the other three. In their battle against relegation‚ they desperately need away success on Sunday as they take on Chippa United at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth. Last season‚ there were three clubs who only won once on the road – Chippa United‚ Free State Stars and Highlands Park‚ who were relegated. “Our away form is psychological‚” said coach Muhsin Ertugral as his side prepared to depart for Port Elizabeth. “We speak a lot about it‚ I’ve tried to find out from my players why it is they do not do well away. This season it has a lot to do with the pressure we are under.” Ertugral said it was also the tactical approach in the past. “When we are away‚ we want to attack but we can’t hold onto the ball. And when we lose the ball we drop back too much.” Ajax will play a much more defensive approach on Sunday looking for counter attack opportunities‚ said their coach… plus their first away win of the season. After their trip to Port Elizabeth‚ Ajax’s last away game of the campaign is against Mamelodi Sundowns in Atteridgeville at the end of the month.
