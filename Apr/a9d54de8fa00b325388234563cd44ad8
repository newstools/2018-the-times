When Adila Chowan first laid her grievance about Mark Lamberti referring to her as “female employment equity” in front of a room of senior managers‚ all she wanted was an apology. He told her: “You’re black‚ you’re female‚ you’re employment equity‚ you’re technically competent. I would like to keep you – but if you want to go‚ go.” These words ended in a racism and sexism grievance and later legal action against Lamberti‚ ultimately costing him his career. His departure as Imperial CEO‚ a position he had held since 2014‚ was announced on Wednesday morning and follows his resignation from the boards of Eskom and Business Leadership South Africa. A day before he fell on his sword‚ Lamberti sent Chowan a one-line apology‚ saying he was sorry for “any hurt my words caused you”.
