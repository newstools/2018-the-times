Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the murder of a Khayelitsha police officer who was killed on duty two weeks ago. Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said that Khayelitsha detectives and members of the Hawks made a breakthrough in the case on Thursday. “The investigation team‚ comprising Khayelitsha detectives and Hawks members‚ arrested a 32-year-old suspect yesterday in connection with the murder of Constable Ncedo Katoyi two weeks ago. The team is still in pursuit of more suspects. The 32-year-old will appear in court on Monday in Khayelitsha on a murder charge‚” said Potelwa. Constable Ncedo Katoyi and his partner responded to a complaint in Site C two weeks ago. On the way back to their vehicle they came under fire from six unknown people who also stole Katoyi’s service pistol. The 39-year-old policeman died on the scene. He was buried on Saturday.
