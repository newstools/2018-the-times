Hosts England will begin their quest for a maiden 50-overs World Cup title against South Africa on May 30 next year with Lord's staging the final on July 14, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced on Thursday. One-day cricket's most coveted trophy has eluded three-times finalists England who staged the first three World Cups between 1975-1983 and also in 1999. Ashes rivals Australia will begin their title defence against qualifiers Afghanistan on June 1 at Bristol. Old Trafford will host the 10-team tournament's most-anticipated match on June 16 between Asian arch-rivals India and Pakistan. The 46-day tournament will be played across 11 venues in England and Wales with Manchester's Old Trafford venue hosting six matches.
