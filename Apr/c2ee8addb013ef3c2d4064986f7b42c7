A half loaf of garlic bread was sent up to the edge of space with the help of a balloon, and eaten after it returned to Earth. The whole idea started as a discussion in a pub, and escalated as Random Aerospace, My Virgin Kitchen and YouTuber Tom Scott came together to see just how the edge of space could change a half loaf of garlic bread. There have been a number of foods launched into the stratosphere over the years, but for the most part they haven't been eaten upon their return. Mainly this is because you're never sure where your space food will land - or what will get to it first. This garlic bread had an advantage over those previous edibles:Â Random Aerospace designed a box that would close once it returned to a certain altitude, making it safe to munch once it landed. So how was it? According to Scott, the half loaf that remained planet-side tasted better, as the stratospheric half was still a little frozen in the middle.
