The moral of this article is: This is SA. It's 2018. The least we can do is learn other people's cultures and languages. Why? Well, despite the fact that it's the right thing to do as a human being, living in a country as diverse as SA should be a huge motivation factor. What happened? Well, DA leader Mmusi Maimane took to Twitter to wish his mother a happy birthday. It was a sweet message that began with Dumelang Bagaetsho and went on to talk about the inspiration that's his mother. Then, Vaughan showed up and in a now deleted tweet and co-wished Mmusi's mom a happy birthday, except he thought her name was Dumelang. *sigh* Vaughan, assumed that the name of the Mmusi's mother was Dumelang, which implies he thought her surname would be Bagaetsho. Obvs that's not her name and also Dumelang Bagaetsho means, 'greetings my people' and is used by thousands of people in Tswana SA daily. In case you are one of the people living in SA without the audacity of at least learning how to say good morning in the 11 official SA languages, here's a list for you: 1 English: Good Morning2 Afrikaans: Goeie Môre3 Ndebele: Lotjhani4 Xhosa: Molweni5 Zulu: Sawubona6 Sepedi: Thobela7 Sesotho: Dumela8 Setswana: Dumelang9 Siswati: Sawubona10 Tshivenda: Matsheloni Avhudi11 Xitsonga: Avuxeni It's not cool to live with people for centuries and not know how to at least say hello in their languages. The situation is often worsened by the fact that greeting in French or Italian or whatever is probably what you know instead... *sigh* Look, you need to do better. Don't be like Vaughan_ZA.
