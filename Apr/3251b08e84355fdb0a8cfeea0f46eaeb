In a fight between a chameleon and a black mamba, you should bet on black. According to Latest Sightings,Â  Casper Badenhorst was driving north on the Voortrekker Road when they came across the chameleon. After huffing and puffing for a bit, it ran down the road, though its back legs didn't seem to be working properly. Eventually it stopped. Right on cue, a black mamba slithered in from the grass, picked it up and headed off for lunch. Black mambas are the fastest snakes in Africa, and the second longest venomous snake. Their venom can kill a human in about 20 minutes, though it generally takes longer. They normally eat smaller mammals and birds, though they have also been known to eat other snakes, including cobras.
