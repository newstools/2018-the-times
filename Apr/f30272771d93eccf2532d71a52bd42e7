Pieter Howes is an EFF supporter‚ because it is “where you should be if you want to be pro-black”‚ he says. If you don't know Howes‚ check out his Twitter profile. It consists of pro-black sentiment‚ a few liberal diatribes‚ defence against -isms. All as a means of him atoning for his ignorance‚ he says. His pinned tweet is: “Everything I say has been said by black folk. Know that I only echo. I should not be praised for doing what’s right.” The sentiment is not dissimilar to White Nonsense Roundup‚ a US organisation that was “created by white people to address our inherently racist society and stand up against racism in our own families‚ work spaces and communities”.
