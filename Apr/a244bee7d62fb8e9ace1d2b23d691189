Do you love golf? Hopefully you don’t love it as much as this man, who was filmed 'having sex with the ninth hole' of an English golf course on Monday. According to the Metro, Steven Gayton was just trying to complete the 18-hole course at Brackenwood Golf Course in Merseyside when he came across the unusual scene. The shirtless man was lying on the grass, his trousers around his knees as he got up close and personal with the flag pole. After about a minute the man places the flag back in the hole, pulls up his trousers and saunters away. ‘He was on his own and it looked like he was doing it for a kick and filming himself doing it,’ Steven said. ‘From where we was it looked like he had his penis in the hole while he had the flag in his backside. It’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever had the misfortune to see."
