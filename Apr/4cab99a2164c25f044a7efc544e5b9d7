As the world reacted on Monday afternoon to the death of 81-year-old struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela earlier in the day, details emerged of her last few days. Her family confirmed that Madikizela-Mandela had died at a Johannesburg hospital surrounded by friends and family. Just days before, she had attended a Good Friday sermon at church with her granddaughter, Zoleka Mandela. Zoleka, who often refers to Madikizela-Mandela as her "day one", posted a collage of pictures of the family at church. Wearing a black skirt and a red top with a collar, Madikizela-Mandela held a walking stick as church-goers greeted her. "I forgot how long the Good Friday service at church is. Over 5 hrs," wrote Zoleka. She said she and her gran had left the service hungry. "My Day One and I left the service so hungry, we had to stop and buy roasted corn on the side of the road to eat en route to the house ... ðŸ˜‚ Time for our family lunch aka CHEAT DAY MEAL," she wrote. Meanwhile, tributes for the struggle stalwart have been pouring in on social media.
