A search operation is continuing for a Norwegian tourist who disappeared on Wednesday while taking a walk on the beach at Sedgefield on the southern Cape coast. According to the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) at Wilderness‚ despite an extensive search‚ so far only a cellphone‚ a hat and shoes belonging to the woman‚ 21-year-old Marie Ostbo‚ have been found. They were discovered on the beach by police in the early hours of Thursday. The SA Police Services‚ Community Police‚ a police K-9 search and rescue unit‚ a police dive unit‚ Western Cape Government Health EMS‚ Wilderness Search and Rescue‚ the ASR/EMS Skymed rescue helicopter‚ NSRI Wilderness crew‚ and Neighbourhood Watch members‚ had searched throughout the day but no trace had been found of the missing woman‚ the NSRI said. “Police are continuing in an ongoing search operation and investigations. “NSRI Wilderness are on alert to assist Police and the Emergency Services and Neighbourhood Watch are continuing to support Police in their ongoing search. “All possibilities are being explored and investigated‚” the NSRI said. The missing woman‚ who was studying in France and on a tour of South Africa‚ arrived in Sedgefield with a group of other young international student tourists on Wednesday. At around 6pm on Wednesday some of the group went for a walk on the beach and returned at around 7pm which was the time that Ostbo was last seen on the beach‚ about 100 metres from the backpackers’ establishment where they were staying. When friends noticed that she had not returned they went searching for her but to no avail. They then contacted the police and NSRI. At the time of her disappearance‚ Ostbo was wearing blue jeans and a white shirt.
