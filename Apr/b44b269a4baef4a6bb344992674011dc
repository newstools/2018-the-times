Minutes after a group of Walmer Township residents clad in ANC T-shirts vowed they would not let a Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality public meeting proceed‚ one resident nearly came to blows with mayor Athol Trollip. The meeting at the Walmer Multi-Purpose Centre descended into complete chaos on Tuesday night when Trollip‚ along with some municipal officials‚ tried to push ahead with the programme. One resident – a man in a pink T-shirt who is alleged to be an ANC branch chairman – went straight for Trollip after a short standoff between the residents and the group representing the municipality. The meeting is one in a series intended for the city to outline the draft Integrated Development Plan (IDP) and also present the draft budget for the 2018-19 financial year. The drama unfolded when a group in ANC T-shirts started picking up chairs and tossing over tables while singing offensive songs. Later‚ a standoff ensued with Trollip trying to talk to the group‚ who were not having any of it and instead singing offensive songs loosely translated as “F*** off Trollip‚ you are full of s***.” - HeraldLIVE
