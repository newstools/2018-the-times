Pearl Thusi and Cassper had Twitter streets in beast mode on Thursday after they took shots at each other over a horse. Yes, a horse. You see, it all started when Pearl Thusi shared that she had recently been horse riding and fell off the horse. While Twitter rushed to check if she was okay, Cassper Nyovest saw the funny side of it and asked her why, as a black woman, she was riding a horse in the first place. Pearl was having none of it and showed Cassper the door. Returning to Twitter she called Cass "narrow-minded" for not knowing that black people rode horses for centuries. Cassper confronted her about it, only for Pearl to hit him back with a "you can’t even ride a donkey". But by then the fans had taken over the conversation and were either running up on Pearl or backing her up.
