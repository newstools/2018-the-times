In fact‚ I couldn't sleep! #Winnie” Bongani Mabhena tweeted: “People fail to understand why some of us refuse to be drawn in to the public persecution of certain prominent individuals.

My heart bleeds thinking about her.” Refilwe Pitjeng tweeted: “I am glad people watched the doccie #Winnie ! There is so much that she did for us‚ I fear people don’t know who we lost.
