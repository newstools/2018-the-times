Gauteng police commissioner Deliwe de Lange said on Friday that attacks on police officers were deliberate attempts to undermine the authority of the state. Her comment follows a petrol bomb attack at the house of a police couple in Ekangala‚ Tshwane East‚ in the early hours of Freedom Day. Police said the man and woman were the only people in the house and were asleep at the time of the attack. They were awoken by what was later confirmed as petrol bombs thrown through a number of windows. “A shootout also ensued‚ as shots were allegedly fired by suspects‚ and the husband returned fire‚ forcing the unknown suspects to flee‚” police said in a statement. “The wife‚ a sergeant in the SAPS‚ sustained burn wounds and was immediately rushed to hospital. The motive behind this attack is yet to be established.” De Lange appealed to the public who have knowledge of the identity or whereabouts of the suspects to assist the police. “Remember‚ harbouring a suspect is a criminal offence. These suspects live within our communities. They are our neighbours‚ friends and/or family. So they are known to someone‚” De Lange said.
