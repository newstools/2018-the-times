Although Isaac Couling was hoping to get a few birdies while playing golf over the weekend, this wasn't what he had in mind. The 16-year-old was walking down the fairway, during a golf tournament between Blissfield High School and Concord High School, when he was suddenly chased and knocked down by an angry goose, reported the Mirror. "They were aware of a goose nest on their left, which they were looking at but not bothering with, when from behind them and to the right came the guard goose (protecting the nest)," said Blissfield golf coach Steve Babbitt, according to the Detroit News. To make matters even worse, Couling fell to the ground a second time while trying to flee from the bird. Needless to say, social media users enjoyed poking fun at his plight. Maybe golf isn't as boring as some think.
