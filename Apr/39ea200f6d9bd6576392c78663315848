Twitter has gone down on Tuesday afternoon after suffering a serious outage. According toÂ downdetector, the problems started just after 3pm in some countries, with the United States, Japan and parts of Europe reporting down time. South Africa was soon to follow. Third party apps such as Tweetdeck and Hootsuite are reportedly working fine for some users, but for those looking to main site or its apps, there is no joy.
