While most of us were watching the social media streets for news of Coachella and other's had enough data to livestream Beyoncé's epic performance, Enhle was there in person. Her bae, Black Coffee, made a comeback at the festival after skipping 2017. He said it was an honour to be asked to perform. And while he got to perform in front of thousands of people, Enhle made sure she pulled out her best and got into the festival spirit. Shuuu. Enhle has legs for days. And there was this pretty outfit for the next round.
