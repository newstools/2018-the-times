A interracial gay couple's wedding served aÂ 503 (server overload) error message on the internet on Our Perfect Wedding this week and led to calls for their pastor to have his own reality show. We knew there would be flames from the moment the couple introduced themselves and said that not everyone in their family would be attending the wedding. The show just got more and more lit with every minute, as the couple prepared for their big day. But perhaps the biggest talking point was the couple's pastor who was a polygamist and was reading verses that don't exist. By then the internet was tired of the drama and decided that it was time to pack up, head home and only return when the pastor came with his own reality show.
