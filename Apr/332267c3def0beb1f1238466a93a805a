This morning all bets were on the Duke and Dutchess of Cambridge's new baby being named Prince Albert, after conspiracy theorists noticed a page with the web address www.royal.uk/prince-albert on the royal family's official website. Then Kate and Wills surprised the world by calling their youngest son, HRH Prince Louis Arthur Charles. The announcement was made on Twitter by Kensington Palace. The little tyke, who is fifth in line for the throne, is thought to be named after the late Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was the first Earl Mountbatten of Burma and the last viceroy of India. According to The Daily Mail, Lord Mountbatten was "cousin to almost every European king" and also "encouraged his nephew Philip to marry the future Queen Elizabeth". That said, Twitter users are having far more fun imagining other famous Louis that the newest royal could have been named after. This includes: KING LOUIE The all-singing, all-dancing regal orangutan from the Disney film The Jungle Book. A lawyer on the TV show Suits, which once starred their soon-to-be sister-in-law, Meghan Markle. This former fictional Prince of Monaco is the ex-husband of Blair Waldorf on the popular series Gossip Girl.
