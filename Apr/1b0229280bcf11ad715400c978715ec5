Solo adventurer Gaven Sinclair plans to jog into Cape Town’s V&A Waterfront on Friday having clocked up more than 5‚000km on an epic trail run across four countries in Africa. The gruelling‚ unsupported run‚ took seven months to reach the finish line. His goal was simple - raise awareness of‚ and funding for‚ Missing Children South Africa. “To go where few would like to go will always be an inspiration in my life‚” he said. Sinclair’s journey started in KwaZulu-Natal in September 2017 and took him to Mozambique’s south-east coast‚ then north through the country before heading west into Zimbabwe. He stopped in Harare‚ then headed for Botswana‚ crossed that country and Namibia before running south from Walvis Bay towards Cape Town. Describing himself‚ he said: “I am an expert at motivation‚ inspiration‚ team building and overcoming challenges. My life coaching style encompasses a number of principles‚ but strictly focuses on health and wellness‚ and the integration of a healthy lifestyle with diet and exercise.” A previous fund-raising adventure saw him cycle the length of Africa‚ from Cape Town to Cairo‚ covering more than 10,000km over 261 days as an ambassador for the charity. He is a motivational speaker and life coach – between his solo adventures. Apparently‚ there is already a new adventure in the pipeline.
