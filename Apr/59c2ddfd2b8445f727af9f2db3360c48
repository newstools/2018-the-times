The internet was a mess on Tuesday night as thousands flooded onto the Twitter streets to celebrate the release of US rapper Meek Mill from prison on bail. Dude spent nearly five months in jail after a court ruled late last year that he had violated his parole conditions. The decision was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Wednesday and he was released on "unsecured bail." As the hashtags turned from #FreeMeekMill to #FreedMeekMill, the dude addressed his masses. In a bunch of Twitter posts the rapper said he was happy to be out and planned to work closely with his legal team to overturn this "unwarranted conviction" and that he looked forward to being reunited with his family and career. But of course that didn't stop the streets from making Meek the meme of the week and cracking jokes about his release. A video of a man making a "phone call" to Meek Mill begging him to delay his release so he could sell some more #FreeMeekMill t-shirts was shared across the internet and had us howling. And the fun didn't end there! Soon everyone was having a laugh and making hilarious jokes and memes about Meek's release. Even Davido wasn't safe. Check out some of our faves. sac sa cs c sc
