We all have hopes and dreams for our children – that they will live happy, healthy and successful lives. We know that achieving these dreams takes effort on our part. The wisest investment we can make in our children is to give them our time – to listen to them, to talk together and to do things together. All of these things happen quite naturally when we spend even a short time each day telling and reading stories together. When we share stories with children, we help to expand their world and build a firm foundation for their futures. How about investing in your children in some of these ways? Whatever it takes, get your children reading material that interests them every day. Once you have helped them to unleash the power of reading in their lives, no one can take this gift away from them. Plus you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you have invested wisely in their futures. Read Everyone Is Special by Kai Tuomi to your children. You can also do the "Get creative!" activity at the end of the story with your children. Enjoy! Two lucky readers can win 10 books each week and donate them to a school, reading club or library of their choice. The third runner-up will win a Nal'ibali reading-at-home starter pack. Books are donated by Tiso Blackstar Group and Jacana Media. To enter, contact patti.mcdonald@tisoblackstar.co.za before 5pm on April 19 and give one reason why we need to read to children in their mother tongue. Include your name, cellphone number and physical address. Winners will be chosen within two weeks. Terms and conditions apply.
