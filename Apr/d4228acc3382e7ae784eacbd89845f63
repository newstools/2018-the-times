If you've ever been to Bree Taxi Rank in downtown Johannesburg, then you know there's entertainment for days. Things that take place at the local rank can only happen in Mzansi. Like the guys who pray for passengers in the hope of getting R1, then there's the cons who will sell you Hugo Boss perfume for R50 (only to realise that the bottle is filled with water). But when you combine the regular morning prayer with the airtime salesman's pitch of "Vodacom, Cell C" then you've got a hit. *On repeat nogal...you will be in stitches* Fam, we have just been out here rolling on the floor!
