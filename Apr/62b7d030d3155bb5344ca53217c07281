“I had to get out very quickly.” This is how a motorist described reacting as his car was sucked nose first into a sinkhole‚ as a pavement collapsed after heavy overnight rains that caused flooding in Cape Town. The man told eNCA that he was waiting to pick up a friend in Delft when the car “just started disappearing to the one side. I tried to steady it but to no avail. (It was) too heavy for us‚” he said‚ as bewildered neighbours took in the scene. Motorists in Cape Town were cautioned to travel with extra care on Thursday due to flooding across the metropole and beyond. Some of the areas affected included sections of road between Table View and Milnerton‚ Edgemead Drive‚ Chapmans Peak and Delft. Disaster Risk Management spokesperson Charlotte Powell said that several informal settlements had been affected by flooding around the city‚ including parts of Khayelitsha: “Assessments are under way. Humanitarian relief has been requested from Sassa.” Roads were also flooded in Uitsig‚ Elsies River‚ Gugulethu and Khayelitsha. “Roads and Stormwater crews have been activated‚” she added. In the north‚ the N1 was reopened at 4am after yesterday's protest action. Truckers heading towards the Drakensberg are however reporting problems on the N3.
