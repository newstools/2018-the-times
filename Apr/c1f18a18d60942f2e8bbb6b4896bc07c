A Pietermaritzburg mother‚ who went on an 11-hour drive to and from Johannesburg in search of her son's R170,000 bicycle‚ found it via Facebook – but she was robbed on Thursday. "You really can't make this stuff up‚" Lynne Jackson said. Jackson was on her way back to Johannesburg on Thursday to fetch the bike when her car was remote-jammed at the Ultra City. "My daughter's cellphone and her backpack‚ which had a camera and a GoPro were taken‚" she said. But meeting Willy Skobane‚ the Gauteng policeman who had found her son's bicycle‚ had restored her faith in humanity. "He was just wonderful. People were actually inboxing him on Facebook to try to get him to sell it to them but he is a good person so he did the right thing and returned it to us‚" Jackson said. Her 18-year-old son's Santa Cruz Downhilling bike‚ which had arrived from the United Kingdom just two days before he participated in the SA Downhill Championships in Hartbeespoort‚ fell off a bicycle rack during the trip back home on Sunday. "That bike was bought from a professional cyclist in the UK. I had not had a chance to insure it and I knew that we just would have not been able to get that same bike even if it was insured‚" Jackson said. When her son arrived in Pietermaritzburg at midnight‚ Jackson got into the car and they drove to Johannesburg. But their search proved fruitless. Jackson then decided to go the social media route‚ and posted the details of the bike and offered a R10‚000 reward. "A friend's sister started looking through pages on Facebook and found a group called Lost & Found. Someone had posted that a bike had been found‚" she said. According to the post by police officer Willy Skobane‚ the bike had been found on the N3 on Sunday. The site that he posted on was actually the official fan page of Johannesburg band Lost&Found. Even after meeting Skobane‚ she still could not believe that they had found the bike. "The past few days have just been strange‚" she said.
