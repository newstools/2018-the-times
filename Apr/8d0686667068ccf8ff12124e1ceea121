Embattled parliamentary chief Gengezi Mgidlana has lost his court bid to stop the institution from proceeding with a disciplinary hearing against him. Mgidlana’s urgent court application to halt a disciplinary hearing was dismissed with costs by the High Court in Cape Town on Friday. This means he will now have to answer to damning findings of an investigation by the audit committee of parliament, which last year found that he acted in breach of the Financial Management of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act and the National Road Traffic Act. This comes after the audit committee investigated allegations from public sector union the National Health Education and Allied Workers Union that Mgidlana had been  awarded a R31,000 bursary to study at the University of South Africa while junior staff were declined, that he travelled with his spouse to work-related meetings and that he ordered parliamentary staff to chauffer him and members of his family in vehicles fitted with blue-lights and that he allegedly instructed his drivers to ignore red traffic lights. The audit committee has made damning findings against him in this regard, which have been kept under wraps for the past six months but the Sunday Times is this morning exposing the closely-guarded report. Mgidlana wanted the high court to interdict his disciplinary, arguing that he wanted to mount a judicial review of the audit committee report. He contended the audit committee had dealt with him unfairly during its investigation and that it had no mandate to carry out the probe in terms of the FMPPLA. Read the full story in the Sunday Times.
