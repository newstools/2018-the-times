Kendrick Lamar has been awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his impactful studio album, DAMN., released last year. It's the first hip-hop album recognised in the history of the Prize. Critically acclaimed as soon as it was out, Rolling Stone deemed him "the greatest rapper alive." The album was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards; it went on to win Best Rap Album. The Pulitzer board described the album as “a virtuosic song collection unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life.” Lamar has resonated in the world of hip-hop, and music at large, since he broke into the mainstream with his 2012 album, Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. A cultural biography about the celebrated rapper is currently in the works.
