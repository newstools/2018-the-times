Cabinet has announced that the North West provincial department of treasury and department of health have been placed under administration. This comes as rolling protests are spreading across the province. Protests are linked to calls for North West premier Supra Mahumapelo to resign. The National Education‚ Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has also been striking since February.
