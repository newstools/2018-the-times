Football's world governing body FIFA said Friday it had banned the head of the Brazilian football federation, Marco Polo Del Nero, for life following a graft probe. FIFA said in a statement that the probe revealed that Del Nero had violated multiple articles of the body's ethics code including those relating to bribery and corruption. "As a consequence, Mr Del Nero is banned for life from all football-related activities (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level," the statement said. "Additionally, a fine in the amount of CHF (swiss francs) 1 million (835,880 euros) has been imposed on Mr Del Nero."
