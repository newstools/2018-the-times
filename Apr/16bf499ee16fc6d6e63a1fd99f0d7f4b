Revenge is sweet‚ but also smooth and bitter with a whiff of banana or bubblegum‚ as some Australians have learned. Following “sandpapergate” during the cricket test between South Africa and Australia‚ a local brewery decided it was payback time. Nico Stone‚ brand manager at Newlands Spring Brewing Co in Cape Town‚ said they took some of their beer to Newlands in western Australia for the locals to sample. They assumed it was brewed locally and loved it. “What better way to prove just how great our beer is than to ask our nation’s biggest rivals to tell us? And tell us they did‚” said Stone. “Sure‚ we may have conveniently forgotten to mention which Newlands the beer really came from‚ but that didn’t stop the Aussies from enjoying every last sip. “Some enjoyed it so much that they went as far as to claim it as their new favourite.” One remarked: “Best bloody beer I’ve ever had.” Their responses were captured on camera. And so was their shock when they were told where the beer came from. “You’re kidding me‚” a shocked Aussie sampler blurted. Stone said it was “all in the spirit of the game”.
