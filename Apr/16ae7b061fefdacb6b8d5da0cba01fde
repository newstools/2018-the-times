The bail application of the man accused of the kidnapping and murder of Durban escort Siam Lee got off to a stilted start in the Durban Regional court – with allegations of a cosy relationship with a prison boss brought into sharp focus on Thursday. The businessman’s bid for bail‚ adjourned twice already and set down for three days this week‚ began at 2pm on Thursday. The 29-year-old faces a raft of charges‚ including the kidnapping and murder of Lee‚ as well as the rape of another woman. He cannot be named until his has tendered a plea in relation to the rape charge. On Tuesday the state revealed that the man is believed to have links to several cases of fraud‚ relating to alleged malfeasance in the operation of his bio-fuel business based in Gauteng. With the man in the witness box‚ the state questioned him on these allegations. The court heard on Thursday that the manager of Westville Prison’s Medium A section‚ where the businessman is detained‚ had placed him in protective custody when he arrived. At one point during his imprisonment‚ a police officer from Johannesburg had attempted to transport him to Gauteng to be questioned on the pending fraud cases. In testimony from the accused‚ the court heard that the prison boss had escorted him to his cell to pack a bag‚ packed him a meal for the road and arranged a jersey for him so he wouldn’t be cold. Prosecutor Surekha Marimuthoo highlighted what she called a “very amicable relationship”. Magistrate Mohamed Motala seemed taken aback by the treatment the man was receiving. “I’m yet to see a prisoner treated as well as you... by your own evidence‚ the manager appears to have taken a special interest in you... I sit here and listen to prisoners complain about their treatment in prison every day. I’ve yet to come across someone who is complimentary of it.” The man denied that the relationship was special. The bail application continues on Friday.
