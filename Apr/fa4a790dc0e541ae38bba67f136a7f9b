After numerous vosho accidents that threatened to see South African's quit dancing, we are happy to announce (in case you've missed the wave) that there's a new version of vosho and it's user friendly. How? Well, unlike the old vosho it doesn't require a lot of technique or complicated moves. The other great news is almost anyone can do it and the risk of paralysis or death is very minimal. • All you need is rhythm (and a head). For example: • You don't have to have your squat game or frog jump on lock, because going down is not compulsory. • You don't have to be fit or a particular body shape to win with this style. • It looks better when you're squad deep, so you don't have to do it by yourself #TeamWork This new vosho is life. Thank you to whomever is responsible for its creation. You have saved many South African lives!
