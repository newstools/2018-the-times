Residents have agreed to halt a land occupation which started in Vrygrond at the weekend. This comes after 15 residents‚ including community leaders‚ met with Mayor Patricia de Lille on Wednesday. “We tabled our issues with the mayor‚” said community leader Daniel Nomavile. “We explained to her that land is a need in the community where people are dependent on social grants and are unable to pay rent due to unemployment.” He said they had agreed to stop residents from occupying the land until they receive feedback from the mayor - expected to be on Monday‚ 23 April. “But we have emphasised that should people not get a response or are not happy with the response we cannot stop the residents from going to occupy the land again‚” said Nomavile. Demolitions carried out by the city led to protests and looting on Monday‚ with Prince George Drive being closed down and a liquor store vandalised. Nosicelo Ngaleka‚ a backyard dweller who attended the meeting‚ said‚ “All we want to hear on Monday is that we can build our shacks on that land. We’re not asking for houses‚ just the land. If we do not get that then we will go back to occupy it. We are not doing this for fun. We are desperate for a way out of the rentals we are staying in.” Mayoral Spokesman Xolani Koyana said‚ “Mayor De Lille is‚ however‚ clear that these grievances should be raised in a peaceful manner and is willing to provide a platform for residents to raise them. “Land invasions which pose a health‚ fire and flooding risk cannot be allowed in Cape Town.” He said the city has committed to investigating the history of the land in question and has also briefed the community leaders on ongoing plans for the area‚ including a housing project that would benefit thousands of residents. Mayoral Committee Member for Transport and Urban Development‚ Brett Herron‚ said a housing development is being planned and the city would communicate the details once the process was finalised.
