The bus stops here - but negotiations between labour unions and bus companies will resume on Thursday as they aim to end the national bus strike. Commuters had to grit their teeth to navigate long‚ frustrating queues to board taxis‚ trains and share lifts as the strike got under way on Wednesday. Wage negotiations between South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council (SARPBAC)‚ the Commuter Bus Employers Organisation and SA Bus Employers Association started in January this year and deadlocked last month. Negotiations will‚ however‚ resume on Thursday at 10am at the Commission for Conciliation‚ Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) and will continue on Friday if necessary. SARPBAC includes the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu)‚ Transport and Allied Workers Union‚ the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) and the Tirisano Transport and Services Workers Union. Employees want a 12% wage increase‚ while employers are offering a 7% increase‚ 7.25% increase the next year‚ and a 7.3% increase in 2020 with a basic minimum wage set at R6‚070. Satawu passenger bus national coordinator Solomon Mahlangu said on Wednesday evening in an interview with the SABC their goal is to hit the employers of bus drivers and the economy “very hard”. “They rake [in a] lot of money‚ whereas the driver becomes the dog of a hunter. The hunter will always take meat and the dog gets bones‚” said Mahlangu. What the unions wants: Who is striking? Who is not striking?
