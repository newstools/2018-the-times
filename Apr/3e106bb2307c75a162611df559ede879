A memorial ride is being organised by the Pedal Power Association to commemorate Ian McPherson who was killed in a bicycle robbery in Cape Town. McPherson‚ 68‚ was stabbed and robbed of his bicycle and cell phone near Fish Hoek on March 13. “The brutal attack in which my father was tragically killed is but one in a recent series of assaults on cyclists and outdoor enthusiasts in the area. Something must be done‚” said his son Rob McPherson. “The local community lost a good man and our family a much-loved husband‚ father‚ grandfather and brother‚” he said. “This cannot continue and hopefully we have now reached a tipping point so that my father’s legacy is not that of a victim‚ but of a man whose death galvanised a community and motivated them to act.” The memorial ride‚ planned for Sunday‚ May 6‚ will include the symbolic placing of a ghost bicycle close to the spot where McPherson lost his life. It will start at the Fish Hoek sports fields and follow one of McPherson’s favourite routes over Chapman’s Peak to Bakoven and back. The memorial ride aims to bring the community together‚ not only in remembrance of McPherson‚ but also to show criminals that their behaviour will not be tolerated. “As a son who lost a father‚ I call upon Helen Zille‚ the Western Cape provincial government and all other local authorities in this country to act now‚” said Rob McPherson. “I call upon them to honour the national constitution‚ to deliver democratic values‚ social justice and our fundamental human rights. I wish to call upon authorities to clean up our streets‚ to resource our police in order to stop senseless and avoidable crimes‚” he added. Pedal Power Association CEO Robert Vogel raised concern about the level of violence when cyclists were attacked. “The victims have no chance when the criminal is prepared to kill in order to steal what he wants‚” he said. The association called on authorities to take steps to secure the safety of cyclists.
