In a passionate speech during Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's funeral, Julius Malema, the leader of the EFF, called out some of the people who attacked her during her lifetime. “Mama those who sold you out to the regime are here. They are crying the loudest more than all of us who cared for you‚” he said. Malema ended his tribute by calling for Cape Town International Airport to be named after Madikizela-Mandela.
