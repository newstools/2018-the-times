A senior DA leader is threatening to take the party to court after his opponent was appointed to a position without an election being held for that particular post. Gauteng  MPL Khume Ramulifho has written to the party’s federal council chairman, James Selfe, challenging the installation of MP Natasha Mazzone to the recently created position of second deputy federal chairperson. This is the first major fallout in the party after it held its national congress last weekend, at which party leader Mmusi Maimane was re-elected unopposed. Mazzone was appointed second deputy chairperson on Thursday following a decision by the party’s federal legal commission. At last weekend’s congress, she was in the running against Ramulifho, Mohammed Hoosen and Thomas Walters for the position of deputy federal council chairperson. Walters won. However, the congress amended the party’s constitution on the same day, a few hours after voting concluded, to create the position of second deputy. “This is a matter of principle and must be defended at all cost. “If the constitution was approved on Saturday before voting on Sunday, it was not going to be an issue, but delegates voted before the amendment to have two deputies was adopted.” On Friday Selfe confirmed that Ramulifho had written to Selfe raising the grievance and  objecting to the decision. But, Selfe said, Ramulifho had not indicated that he (Ramulifho) was going to take the matter to court. Mazzone said Ramulifho was welcome to take the matter to court.
