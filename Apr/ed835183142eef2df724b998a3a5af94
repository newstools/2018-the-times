Dancing isn't a classic catwalk move, but it certainly is a crowd pleaser. Nomzamo Mbatha thrilled show-goers at SA Fashion Week last night by breaking it down on the runway as she modeled an extravagant red ball gown. The gown was designed by celeb fave, Gert-Johan Coetzee, who collaborated with McDonald's to create a collection celebrating the Big Mac's 50th birthday. With separates in the brand's signature red and yellow, and tees emblazoned with the Golden Arches, the collection was not to everyone's taste. That said, the guest appearance by Mbatha certainly added spice to the evening. The actress later poked fun at herself for committing a minor fashion faux paus, posting on Instagram: "What not to do on the runway? DANCE ... But everyone joined in so I guess my moves ain’t that bad."
