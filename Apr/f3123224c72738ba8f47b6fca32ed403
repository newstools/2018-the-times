Parliament’s portfolio committee on sport and recreation wants the Premier Soccer League (PSL) to brief it about the violence and vandalism after Free State Stars beat Kaizer Chief on Saturday night at the Moses Mabhida stadium in Durban. Violence erupted after Chiefs lost the Nedbank Cup semi-final match. The pandemonium left many people injured and property damaged. A security guard‚ a ball boy and several spectators were among those injured. The damage to the stadium and technical equipment belonging to broadcasters is said to amount to millions. Two vehicles that were parked at the back of the stadium were also damaged. Police and stadium security were overrun as fans invaded the pitch at the end of the game‚ heading directly for embattled Chiefs coach Steve Komphela‚ who quit immediately after the game. Committee chairperson Beauty Dlulane said they want clarity on “some apparent grey areas” in security at sporting events. “The issue of security at events of that magnitude‚ where a club as big as Kaizer Chiefs is involved‚ needs to be a top priority‚” Dlulane said. “The committee is also concerned about the frequency with which these incidents occur.” Police spokesman Brigadier Jay Naicker said on Monday a “high-level” team had been assembled to investigate what transpired at the stadium. The committee might visit the stadium to assess the damage.
