Baseball's biggest rivalry got even more intense after a mass brawl during the MBL match between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The fight, involving players and coaches, was sparked as the Yankees' Tyler Austin charged towards Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly after being hit by the ball. Tempers were already frayed because of an earlier incident in the match on Wednesday night. Both benches cleared after Austin's spikes clipped Brock Holt's leg on a slide into second base. "Once I got hit, it was going to happen," Austin said after the match, according to ESPN. After the brawl, Kelly and Austin were ejected, as well as Yankees third-base coach Phil Nevin and Yankees relief pitcher Tommy Kahnle. The match ended with the Yankees halting the Red Sox’s nine-game winning streak with 10-7 victory. On Thursday, the Baltimore Sun reported that Major League Baseball had suspended Kelly for six games, while Austin was given a five-game suspension. Both players plan to appeal their penalties.
