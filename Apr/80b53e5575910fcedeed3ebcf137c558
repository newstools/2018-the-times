Two Airports Company SA (Acsa) directors‚ Steven Mabela and Siyakhula Simelane‚ say they have resigned from the board of the state-owned entity‚ over what they call corporate governance issues and political interference with the work of the board. Acsa hired Dr VS Mncube Consulting to investigate alleged irregularities in its supply-chain management. The firm’s report‚ dated August 4 2016‚ noted that it would be in the best interest of Acsa for Maseko and others to "be suspended or put on special leave pending the finalisation of the disciplinary proceedings‚ to create an environment which is conducive for a proper investigation of the charges". In his letter to Nzimande‚ Mabela said the minister had brought the Acsa board into disrepute "by unsubstantiated interference or narrative" during radio interviews‚ during which he inferred that certain board members had "Gupta links or associations". - BusinessLIVE
