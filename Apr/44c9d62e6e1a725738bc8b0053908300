Reality television star Khloe Kardashian gave birth to her first child on Thursday, according to US media reports. Celebrity website TMZ, television show Entertainment Tonight and the New York Post’s Page Six column reported that Kardashian gave birth to a baby girl in a hospital outside Cleveland, Ohio, early on Thursday morning. Kardashian’s representatives did not immediately return a request for comment. The baby girl is the third child born into the reality television family this year following older sister Kim Kardashian’s daughter Chicago in January, by a surrogate, and younger half-sister Kylie Jenner’s daughter Stormi with rapper Travis Scott in February. Kardashian, 33, who has documented her pregnancy on Instagram where she has more than 74 million followers, announced in December that she was expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, who plays basketball for the NBA’s Cleveland Cavaliers. Kardashian gave birth days after multiple media reports that Thompson had been caught on video kissing other women as recently as a few days ago, and also last autumn. Neither Kardashian nor Thompson have commented on those reports. “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” has turned Khloe Kardashian, her five siblings and mother into some of the most influential celebrities with massive social media followings and multi-million dollar fashion, beauty and other businesses. Khloe Kardashian was previously married to basketball player Lamar Odom. Thompson is also the father of a son with former girlfriend Jordan Craig, a lifestyle blogger who gave birth in 2016 after the athlete started dating Kardashian. -Reuters
