Ever wanted to go on a tour of the moon? Well now you can. Nasa’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has allowed the space agency to put together an all-new virtual tour of the moon in 4K resolution. Originally designed as a one year mission, the LRO has been collecting data on lunar topography, temperature, resources, solar radiation, and geology since it launched nine years ago. The video features more than half a dozen locations of interest, while Nasa also highlighted the individual sites in a Tumblr post. This is the second lunar tour that Nasa has released. The original, much lower resolution tour was released in 2011.
