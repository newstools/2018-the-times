Rocky the sheepdog must have thought he was such a good boy when he herded a flock of sheep into his owner's house. Rosalyn Edwards was busy working in the kitchen when she heard a suspicious noise. When she investigated she was shocked to find nine sheep huddled in her home, reported the Telegraph. The seven-month-old border collie decided to herd the sheep after the gate was left open. "It was funny at the time, but then there was quite a lot of wee, poo and mud everywhere," Edwards said. The Devon farmer said this was the first time the puppy had driven the sheep into the house and by the look of things, they were just as surprised. Eventually the flock was marched out via the front door, leaving a trail of muck in their wake.
