Leaders Manchester City shrugged off a bitterly disappointing week to beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-1 at Wembley on Saturday and move to within three points of sealing the Premier League title. City, who were deprived of wrapping up the title in dream fashion last weekend when they lost at home to Manchester United and were then knocked out of the Champions League by Liverpool on Tuesday, were two up after 25 minutes as they hit back with a vengeance. Gabriel Jesus opened the scoring in the 22nd minute before Ilkay Gundogan slotted home a penalty three minutes later after Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris raced out of his goal and upended Raheem Sterling on the edge of the area. Christian Eriksen's goal shortly before halftime offered fourth-placed Tottenham a route back into the game but Sterling lashed home from close range in the 72nd minute. City may well have to wait another week to start celebrating a third title in seven seasons although it could happen as soon as Sunday in the unlikely event of Manchester United losing at home to bottom club West Bromwich Albion. Tottenham, who had gone 14 matches unbeaten in the league since losing 4-1 at City in December, are seven points above fifth-placed Chelsea in the race for Champions League qualification.
