Striking members of the National Education‚ Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu) at the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Johannesburg have strewn litter in the hospital’s main foyer. Medical waste and rubbish were scattered all over the hospital’s floors on Thursday‚ with no patients in sight and the hospital appearing to be only half operational. The workers‚ who include nurses and support staff such as cleaners and porters‚ are unhappy with the hospital’s lack of remuneration for overtime and non payment of performance bonuses. “Workers are angry and feel they are being taken for granted. They put in the work but when it comes to payment there is none‚” said Gracia Rikhotso‚ Nehawu Gauteng deputy secretary. Rikhotso added that the hospital’s management and the provincial health department were not willing to speak to them. Since going on strike‚ the protesters have been disrupting the operation of the hospital.
