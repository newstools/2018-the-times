The Glebelands seven – an alleged hit squad of guns for hire‚ operating from the notorious Umlazi hostel – will remain behind bars. On Thursday the seven appeared before magistrate Siphiwe Hlope‚ who denied their bid for liberty while awaiting trial. Detective sergeant Bhekukwazi Louis Mdweshu‚ 27‚ Ncomecile Matlala Ntshangase‚ 34‚ Khayelihle Mbuthuma‚ 32‚ Eugene Wonderboy Hlope‚ 45‚ Mbuyiselwa Mahliphiza Mkhize‚ 28‚ Vukani Mcobothi‚ 25‚ and Mondli Talente Mthethwa‚ 28‚ appeared briefly in the Durban Regional Court on Tuesday. Mbuthuma and Mthethwa did not apply for bail. Hlope said bail was refused as the court took into account the safety of both the accused and the community‚ including state witnesses and so called "rival factions". The seven face a raft of charges‚ including murder‚ attempted murder and racketeering. The group was arrested in a series of raids in December last year. Scores of people have been killed in the hostel‚ which was described as a haven for assassins and criminals. The Moerane commission of inquiry‚ established to probe political killings in the province‚ heard testimony that the death of former ANC Youth League general secretary Sindiso Magaqa was orchestrated from the hostel. Magaqa was shot in a drive-by shooting in Umzimkhulu in July and died in hospital. The hostel‚ administered by the Ethekwini municipality‚ is considered to be a hotbed of violence and crime. Comprising squalid and poorly-maintained blocks‚ the hostel is overcrowded and rundown. Police have been hard-pressed to crack down on the housing complex‚ even having to look into their own ranks for suspects. The seven will appear in court again on May 31.
