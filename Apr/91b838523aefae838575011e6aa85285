President Cyril Ramaphosa commemorated the life of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in a moving eulogy delivered before she was laid to rest on Saturday‚ where he apologised for failing to properly honour her in her lifetime. “I’m sorry Mama‚ in according you honour so late. I am sorry we delay this much‚” Ramaphosa said at the funeral at the Orlando Stadium‚ an area in Soweto she called home until she passed on. Ramaphosa acknowledged that it was far too often that they were not there for Madikizela-Mandela during her life fighting the apartheid regime and since the dawn of democracy. “As we bid her farewell‚ we are forced to admit that too often as she rose‚ she rose alone‚” he said.
