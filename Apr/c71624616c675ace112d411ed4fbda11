Chemical weapons experts have not yet been able to visit the Syrian town of Douma to probe an alleged poison gas attack, the head of the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Monday. "The team has not yet deployed to Douma," Ahmet Uzumcu told emergency talks of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Russian and Syrian officials "have informed the... team that there were still pending security issues to be worked out before any deployment could take place," he added.
