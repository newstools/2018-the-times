Just when you thought you had seen it all on the internet, including chicken's playing piano, you stumble across a video that is pure gold: the discovery of "Nigeria's own Nicki Minaj and Cardi B". A video of two women apparently chilling on a film set acting the fool has gone viral after they started shaking booty and rapping Tupac. The video starts in the middle of the performance, with one of the queens dropping bars from Tupac's Hit Em Up, while her friend is doing the most over there with the twerk game. Things to watch out for include: The head nod by twerker bae as she feels herself. The thread stretching on twerker bae's skirt. Rapping bae with the "look at God." And the drop mic moment at the end.
