Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leaders were on Saturday afternoon involved in a scuffle over entry to the Fourways Memorial Park in Johannesburg, where Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was being laid to rest. A few minutes after the Presidential Protection Unit arrived at the park at 4pm‚ a scuffle reportedly broke out when EFF leader Julius Malema and senior EFF members Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and Floyd Shivambu were denied entry to the grounds. They loudly demanded to know why they were being prevented from entering the memorial park. Malema allegedly told a soldier who tried to stop him that "no white man can stop me". The three were eventually allowed to enter and take their seats. Earlier that day at Orlando Stadium, Malema gave a fiery speech in tribute to the lat struggle icon. “Mama those who sold you out to the regime are here. They are crying the loudest more than all of us who cared for you‚” he said. Malema ended his tribute by calling for Cape Town International Airport to be named after Madikizela-Mandela. The Sunday Times meanwhile has learnt that there have been informal discussions between senior leaders of the ANC and EFF after the late Madikizela-Mandela expressed her wish to them that Malema either lead a comeback to the governing party, or that they co-operate in the national interest.
