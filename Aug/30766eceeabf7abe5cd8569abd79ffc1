All we could say after listening to Nasty C's freestyle on Hot 97 was, "kill us, we are your bars!"

And we can say this with confidence because there's proof! Taking his time to impress while on his Strings and Bling promotion tour in the States, the rapper gave Americans a taste of his freestyle skills when he jumped on a beat on Ebro in the morning onÂ Hot 97.

Then he said, "All my verses could free ya/I'm a priest when you need one/My competition is missin' claim your reward when you see them" *insert Ohhhhhhhhhhh!* But we just couldn't take it anymore when he said, "I smoke the kind of pot that makes you put the stove on it..."
