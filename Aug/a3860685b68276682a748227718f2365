Joseph Molangoane was left devastated after he went off with a broken leg in Kaizer Chiefs' 3-0 MTN8 quarterfinal win against Free State Stars at FNB Stadium on Saturday night. Chiefs' little winger had been influential in a resurgent performance by Amakhosi as they produced far better movement in their frontline than in a 3-1 midweek league defeat to Bidvest Wits at the same venue. In the 50th minute Molangoane went in for a sliding challenge on Makhehleni Makhaula as Stars' left-back was playing a clearance and the sickening clash saw the Chiefs player stretchered off. Afterwards Amakhosi coach Giovanni Solinas confirmed Molangoane's broken leg, and said this was a huge blow to his team. "We are very happy for this victory but we are also shocked because we lost a nice guy like Joseph," Solinas said. "We dedicate this victory to Joseph. It's a serious injury. I hope this player can come back quickly. "My players are shocked in the dressing room. Some are very sad. "'Rama' [Ramahlwe Mphahlele] spoke to him [Molangoane] now. He is shocked. They lost a team-mate, we lost an important player." Amakhosi midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase went off injured later, but Solinas said this was a knock.
