Plans are in motion to change the Nelson Mandela Bay government before the end of next week. At a meeting in Port Elizabeth on Thursday‚ leaders from the ANC‚ EFF‚ UDM‚ AIC‚ United Front and Patriotic Alliance took a decision to remove mayor Athol Trollip through a no-confidence motion. There are plans to form a new coalition government. This was confirmed by AIC general secretary Mahlubi Jafta‚ Patriotic Alliance president Gayton McKenzie and UDM regional leader Mongameli Bobani on Thursday afternoon. McKenzie said: "We are removing this administration. "The PA can no longer be blind to the fact the DA is evicting coloured and black people only. "[The] Bay needs new and fresh leadership - leadership that will not have youth run to Jo'burg for opportunities. "Huge changes [are] coming." The meeting was also attended by Faith Muthambi of the ANC‚ EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee and Zanoxolo Wayile of United Front. The parties are in the process of getting signatures from all opposition councillors to petition speaker Jonathan Lawack to hold a special council meeting by no later than next week Friday.
