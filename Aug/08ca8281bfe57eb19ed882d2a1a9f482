The Mpumalanga police are investigating the possible murder and suicide of a constable and her partner in Mhluzi.

Her colleagues went to her house around 10am where they found the gate‚ doors and windows were locked.

Both were lying in a pool of blood‚ with gunshot wounds to their upper body and [they] were certified dead at the scene.” The police are investigating a possible murder and suicide.
