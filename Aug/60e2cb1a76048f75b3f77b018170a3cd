As the news of ProKid's death settles in the hearts of thousands of fans, they've kicked off the #ProKidChallenge in honour of him. The challenge was created by the masses who wanted to show how much ProKid's music served and meant to to them.

Since then social media has been flooded with messages of condolences and tributes for ProKid. But most importantly, his fans have celebrated his gift and showed their gratitude for songs that resonated with them the most. Thus the #ProKidChallenge was born. Here are some of the videos.
