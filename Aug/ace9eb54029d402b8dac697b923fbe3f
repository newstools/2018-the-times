Eskom says there is a high risk of load-shedding on Wednesday evening. Spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the power supply would be constrained during the evening. “Please switch off all non-essential appliances in order to reduce pressure on the national grid. “Eskom will continue to provide regular updates through various media platforms‚” he added. The power utility said earlier in a statement: “Eskom is currently not load-shedding however the risk remains high‚ especially for the evening peak period from 5pm to 9pm. This is due to a number of our generating units being out on maintenance and possibly not being back in time to meet the evening peak period.”
