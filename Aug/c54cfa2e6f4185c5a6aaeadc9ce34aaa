Talk about being a pampered mama-to-be. A month after celebrating the arrival of her daughter, Jessica Nkosi's friends have joined forces to throw her another baby shower. As if that wasn't enough, Jessica had three outfit changes for the special occasion. Why? Well, why not? Here's a peek into the special day. Jessica and her bae,Â Uzalo's Ntokozo Dlamini can't wait to welcome their little girl into the world. Even though there was speculation around her pregnancy, Jessica told True Love magazine that she was not trying to hide it at first, she just didn't want any drama. "There's nothing scandalous about my pregnancy. Therefore, I don't want any drama around it and I certainly don't want anyone to have an opinion about it."
