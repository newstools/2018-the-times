The testimony of former ANC MP, Vytjie Mentor, has revealed how former President Jacob Zuma tried to recruit her as a pliant minister through the Guptas. But it has also included some strange statements and rambling moments. Here are five of the best: "The signature looks like mine but I don’t remember being at the place it was signed" "It’s looking like my signature but I normally close the ‘P’." "He came to me with the corrupted statement. I showed him how corrupt it was in my handwriting." "This document is supposed to be a supplementary statement but it doesn’t say what is it supplementing." "If I signed it, I would have made a mistake. If I signed it."
