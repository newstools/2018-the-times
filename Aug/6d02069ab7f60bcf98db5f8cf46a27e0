Parliament erupted in laughter on Thursday when deputy speaker Lechesa Tsenoli told an EFF member she had her "dipstick in the wrong hole". During Deputy President David Mabuza’s parliamentary Q&A, the EFF alleged that Tsenoli was unfairly giving the ANC more time to speak. "You’ve got your dipstick in the wrong hole," Tsenoli replied. "Absolutely, this is why you're getting a wrong reading." After the remarks, members of opposing political parties were uncharacteristically united as they laughed in unison.
