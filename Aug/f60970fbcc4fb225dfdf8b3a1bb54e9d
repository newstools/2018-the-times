A student is believed to have been killed overnight during clashes following SRC elections at the Tshwane University of Technology’s Soshanguve campus outside of Pretoria‚ the Democratic Alliance Student Organisation said on Friday. The elections were held on Thursday. “The ongoing campus violence has sadly resulted in the tragic death of one student‚ after the police allegedly fired shots at a group of students‚” said Daso chairperson‚ Sam Beynon. She said they were deeply concerned about the violence and conveyed their condolences to the student’s family and friends. “We will now proceed to write to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) and Police Minister Bheki Cele to urgently investigate why the police used live ammunition on the group students‚” said Beynon. “We condemn this use of force. It is paramount that law enforcement and private security act with restraint in volatile environments.” The uproar was believed to have erupted after the SRC elections were announced‚ with some students alleging that the votes had been rigged. Amid the unrest‚ students took to social media to post videos of the chaos which unfolded. Some videos showed that several fires had been started on the campus‚ with disgruntled students setting alight ballot papers. The police and university spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment. This is a developing story.
