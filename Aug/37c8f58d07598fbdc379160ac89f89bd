Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas is expected to face tough questions when he testifies in the Zondo commission of inquiry investigating state capture on Friday. Advocate Phillip Mokoena will be leading evidence and is expected to ask Jonas detailed questions on how the Guptas in 2015 allegedly offered him the job of finance minister and a R600â€š000 bribe that would balloon to R600-million should he accept.
