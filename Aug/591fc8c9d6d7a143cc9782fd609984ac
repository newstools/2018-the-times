Friends, family and fans have gathered at Bassline in Johannesburg on Thursday afternoon to celebrate ProKid's life. The musician, who has been dubbed as the 'pioneer of hip-hop' died on August 8, after suffering from a seizure. The stage has been adorned with dozens of white flower arrangements as mourners stream into the venue. Celebrity funeral artist Lebani Sirenje has already begun painting a portrait of Pro, as t-shirts in his honour are being sold outside the venue. Rapper Cassper Nyovest told TshisaLIVE that Pro inspired kids like him to believe they could make it.
