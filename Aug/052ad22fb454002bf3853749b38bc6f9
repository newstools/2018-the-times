Artist Amanda Mjindi, 30, did not consider it an extreme act to simply move her few items of furniture into an empty house in the swanky Pretoria suburb of Brooklyn. The house is said to be worth about R3m, but for her living under its roof is priceless. She said it was an act of “desperation”, but Mjindi and her friends still found themselves in a court battle when the executor of the estate of the deceased owners launched an urgent application to have them evicted. However, she has help in the form of Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama, who arranged legal assistance. For more on this story, please visit Times Select.
