President Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out at his former White House aid Omarosa Manigault Newman in especially angry terms, slamming her as a "dog" and "crazed" as their mud-slinging match escalated. Manigault Newman -- who gained fame as a contestant on Trump's reality TV show "The Apprentice," and then secured a $180,000-a-year staff job at the White House -- on Monday released a recording of a private conversation she had with the president after she was fired. Trump had already branded "Omarosa" -- as she is commonly known in America -- a "lowlife" after she released a recording of her firing by chief of staff John Kelly, seemingly recorded in the White House Situation Room. But on Tuesday, he ratcheted up the war of words -- to a level of nastiness rarely seen, even from a president who has shown he doesn't pull punches when insulting his critics. "When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!" Trump tweeted. The recordings by the disgruntled 44-year-old Manigault Newman, once an ardent Trump ally, represents a stunning breach of presidential trust. On Tuesday, she explained to CBS News why she made the recordings: "I'm the kind of person who covers her own back. In Trump World, everyone lies." "Everyone says one thing one day and they change their story the next day. I wanted to have this type of documentation... in the event I found myself in this position where, as you said, they're questioning my credibility." Manigault Newman's tell-all book, "Unhinged," hits bookstores on Tuesday.
