The Rhino 9 Task Team is a multidisciplinary team operating in Mpumalanga‚ consisting of members from the police‚ the South African Revenue Service (SARS)‚ the South African National Defence Force (SANDF)‚ SANParks and Ezemvelo Nature Reserve. Of the 365 suspects‚ 165 remain in custody as their court processes continue.
