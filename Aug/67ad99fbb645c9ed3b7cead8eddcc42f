Sunday Times journalist Qaanitah Hunter gives us a break down of what can be expected from the commission of inquiry into state capture which kicks off on Monday. The commission will be headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Along with his crack team of six commissioners - seasoned legal doyens and number crunchers — Zondo will have the enormous task of piecing together how the state was captured by the Gupta family and their business associates and how deep the corruption crept. Over the next two years‚ they will go through copious files and several witnesses with an end goal - to recommend criminal prosecution. Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas and former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor are expected to be two of the witnesses called at the first hearings.
