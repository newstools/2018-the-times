Jennifer and Loyiso Bala welcomed their second child together in May and now the hot mama has given us a glimpse of her post-baby body. And fam, it's like... Jen was at Glammy's 50th birthday celebration and looked stunning in a black three-piece creation. She said she almost didn't attend because she had just had a "massive hormonal breakout." "Nearly didnâ€™t go because I was alone at home with her, had just had a massive hormonal breakout (most of the hectic bumps are covered by my strategically placed hair, while some are on my neck), was exhausted, had to time when I could shower and never mind get to the hairdresser on time and feed in-between." Clearly she cleans up well!
