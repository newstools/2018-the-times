Enraged Twitter users are trying to track down a man who boasted there are no “k****rs” on his beach holiday. The video went viral on social media on Tuesday. “Let me give you a weather forecast here: Blue skies‚ beautiful day‚ amazing sea and not one k****r in sight. F***ing heaven on earth.” He then points to the camera and says: “You cannot beat this. You cannot beat this.” EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi tweeted: “Racism Alert] we are looking for this white boy. Anyone who knows him‚ his name and where he is based‚ please DM me… (sic).” TV and radio personality Robert Marawa said: “We pray for him and what should be his permanent stay on that heavenly rock!!”
