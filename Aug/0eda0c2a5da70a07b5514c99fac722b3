Manyama joined Chiefs on a three-year deal on Wednesday and he revealed that he has supported Kaizer Motaung's side from a young age. "It’s a dream come true‚" the Alexander-born midfielder told the club. "I have supported Chiefs from a young age. "I grew up on the same street as Brian Baloyi in Alexandra and that’s how I fell in love with the club." The 27-year-old Bafana Bafana star will bolster Chiefs’ attacking options. "I now want to help the club win trophies and to achieve glory‚ because that’s what the Kaizer Chiefs brand represents to me‚" he added. Manyama will reunite with his former Ajax Cape Town teammate Khama Billiat and they are expected to intimidate defenders this season.
