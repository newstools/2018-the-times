Perfume testers in Edgars stores are not filled with perfume – but neither are they filled with vinegar. Instead‚ they’re filled with a coloured liquid and a preservative. Edcon chief executive Grant Pattison made the admission on Twitter on Monday afternoon. He was commenting in response to a tweet by Radio 702 presenter Aki Anastasiou on Sunday. “Seriously @EdgarsFashion Sandton City I’m flabbergasted. Walk into your store’s Chanel section to purchase a fragrance. Took a tester sprayed it on me ... I smell vinegar. Assistant tells me your testers are filled with vinegar - Edgars is that what a premium experience is about?” he said. Pattison responded on Monday: “Update. So obviously I can confirm ‘testers’ are not filled with vinegar. Display items are filled with a coloured liquid and a preservative. This is the common practice. What seems to have happened is the display item ended up with a nossle on it. Apologies‚ Aki.” Edgars is part of the Edcon group. But the Twitterati never missed the opportunity to crack some jokes about the saga.
