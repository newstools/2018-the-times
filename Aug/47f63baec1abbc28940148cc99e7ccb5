Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews won the toss and elected to bat against South Africa in the second one-day international in Dambulla on Wednesday. The hosts, who lost the opening ODI of the five-match series on Sunday, have made two changes to their starting line-up. Paceman Kasun Rajitha and left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya have been handed their ODI debuts as they replace injured Lahiru Kumara and Lakshan Sandakan. The Faf du Plessis-led South Africa have gone in with an unchanged team after winning the first match by five wickets at the same venue.
