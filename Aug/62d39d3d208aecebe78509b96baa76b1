According to the document itself‚ the new bill "seeks to amend the act to make the state the sole holder of the shares in the bank and to give powers to the minister to exercise the rights attached to the shares in the bank‚ of which the state is the owner. “The bill further seeks to provide for the appointment process of directors of the board that instead of being elected at an ordinary general meeting of shareholders‚ will now be appointed by the minister.” Parliament tweeted a link to the bill‚ which you can read here:
