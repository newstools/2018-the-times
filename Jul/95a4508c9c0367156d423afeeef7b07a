Visa-free travel is fuss-free travel. There's no mountain of paperwork to fill in, or visa application fee to pay, before you can jet off somewhere exotic for a much-needed holiday. While South Africans don't have the globe's most powerful passport, there are still plenty of fascinating destinations we can visit visa free. An impressive 68 in fact, according to the 2018 Henley Passport Index. This Index ranks the world's passports from strongest (Japan and Singapore) to weakest (Iraq and Afghanistan) based onÂ data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The Henley Passport Index's interactive website is updated in real time, as and when visa-policy changes come into effect, making it a handy resource to use when planning your next overseas holiday. Here are the 68 destinations which it currently states South Africans don't need a visa to visit: Angola Botswana Kenya Lesotho Malawi Mauritius Mozambique Namibia Reunion Senegal Swaziland Tanzania Tunisia Zambia Zimbabwe Argentina Belize Brazil Chile Costa Rica Ecuador El Salvador Falkland Islands Guatemala Guyana Honduras Nicaragua Panama Paraguay Peru Uruguay Venezuela Hong Kong Indonesia Macao Malaysia Philippines Singapore South Korea Thailand Antigua and Barbuda Bahamas Barbados British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Dominica Dominican Republic Grenada Haiti Jamaica Montserrat St. Kitts and Nevis St. Lucia St. Vincent and the Grenadines Trinidad and Tobago Turks and Caicos Islands Ireland Kosovo Russian Federation Georgia Israel Palestinian Territory Qatar Cook Islands Fiji Micronesia Niue Vanuatu
