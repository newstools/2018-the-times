Johannesburg’s five star hotels played host to the world’s powerful leaders during the Brics summit this week. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his delegation made the Westcliff Hotel their home. Waiters said the Russians guzzled craft beer after a long day at the Sandton Convention Centre, where the 10th annual Brics summit was held. The Chinese took over the Michelangelo at the Sandton Mandela Square. President Xi Jinping is said to have brought his own furniture. "For the president, they brought their own furniture and took everything else out. They brought their own food.
