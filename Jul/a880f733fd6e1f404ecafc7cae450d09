An ANC councillor had to flee her home while still in her nightgown on Thursday morning‚ after angry protesters torched her Mdantsane home. Buffalo City Metro Ward 24 councillor Zameka Kodwa-Gajula was fast asleep when she was awoken by the sound of breaking glass‚ only to discover that the lower section of her bed was already on fire. She was with two members of her family‚ including her 20-year-old daughter‚ when the incident occurred after 3am on Thursday.
