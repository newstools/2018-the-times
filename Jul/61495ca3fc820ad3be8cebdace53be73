Having to get a visa isn't only a lot of admin and an extra expense, but it spoils the fun for travellers who like to be spontaneous. If you're one of them, you'll be chuffed to know that there are 34 global destinations where South African passport holders can get a visa on arrival. (And another 68 which we don't need a visa to visit at all.) That's according to the 2018 Henley Passport Index, which uses data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to rank world's passports from strongest (Japan and Singapore) to weakest (Iraq and Afghanistan). The Henley Passport Index's interactive website is updated in real time, as and when visa-policy changes come into effect, making it a useful resource for anyone planning an overseas trip. It currently states that there are 34 destinations where South Africans can get a visa on arrival, including: Cambodia Kyrgyzstan Laos Maldives Nepal Sri Lanka Tajikistan Timor-Leste Benin Cape Verde Islands Comores Islands Djibouti Ethiopia Gabon Ghana Guinea-Bissau Madagascar Mauritania Rwanda Seychelles Somalia St. Helena Togo Uganda Marshall Islands Palau Islands Samoa Tuvalu Bolivia Armenia Iran Jordan Oman Turkey
