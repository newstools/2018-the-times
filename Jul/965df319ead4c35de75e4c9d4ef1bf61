UCOOK, founded by Christopher Verster-Cohen, is a dinner-kit delivery service where the customer does the cooking. A great idea for inspiring people to cook without any hassle - no shopping and little prep as everything is measured out and each dish comes with a recipe card. There's no compromise on the quality of ingredients. They offer a varied selection of meal kits categorised under Easy Peasy, Health Nut and Vegetarian. They have collaborated with musician and My Kitchen Rules South Africa judge J'Something till mid-August, featuring his Portuguese recipes and other favourites. I had my money on J'Something and ordered three of his meal kits - caldo verde soup, which came with a large bunch of fresh kale and imported chorizo sausage; rump steak and winter greens spaghetti; and a pork sandwich in a roll with carrot chips. There's no food wastage as the kits contain the exact amounts to make the meal. Top marks for the kit, which arrives beautifully packaged in an insulated cardboard box, with cooler bricks and a recipe card. Niggle? It takes about five days from ordering to delivery. A box of three meals - as I enjoyed - containing two portions of each costs R630 including delivery. Available in all big cities.
