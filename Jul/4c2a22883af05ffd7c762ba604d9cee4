Listen up, fam! If you're like us you've probably been using your weekends to hide under the duvet and can't stop reaching for those rusks. But we all know summer bodies are made in winter. Like Unathi Msengana, Boity Thulo and Nomzamo Mbatha, Wendy Parker is not letting the cold get the best of her. Nah. Instead she's been hitting the gym and her gains are for everyone to see. We mean, it's not like we haven't already had body envy. We've BEEN thirsting over Wendy for ages now. But ja, she's just taken it to a whole new level.
