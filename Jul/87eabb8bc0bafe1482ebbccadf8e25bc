Photographer Ruvan Boshoff said fire in one train had spread to the train alongside it‚ and firefighters had run out of water. “The heat is intense. The trains cannot be saved‚ but the firefighters are intent on reducing the heat so the flames do not spread any further‚” he said. Layne said no injuries had been reported. Platforms 15 and 16 were affected by the fire‚ and there was no indication what had started it.
