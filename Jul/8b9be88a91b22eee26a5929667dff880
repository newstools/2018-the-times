The head of a controversial Ethiopian scheme to dam the waters of the Blue Nile was shot in the head on Thursday in a daylight killing in Addis Ababa, police said. Simegnew Bekele was the project manager and public face of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a massive scheme that has triggered fears among downstream users of the Nile, including Egypt. Federal police commissioner Zeynu Jemal said Simegnew was shot in the right side of his head, and a gun was later found nearby. Simegnew had been in his office early on Thursday, Jemal added. Images circulating on social media showed a gold Toyota 4x4 with a shattered rear passenger window surrounded by police officers in the downtown Meskel square. The state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting Corporate earlier reported Simegnew "has been found dead in his car at Meskel Square". The dam has faced opposition from Egypt, which fears the $4-billion (R53-billion) project on the Blue Nile which is expected to produce 6 000 megawatts - the equivalent of six nuclear reactors - will affect the river's downstream flows. In May, Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia agreed to set up a scientific committee to study the dam's impact. The renaissance dam is one of several "mega-projects" Ethiopia is pursuing that include railways and industrial parks aimed at transforming its economy and pulling the country out of poverty. Construction started in 2011, and two of its 16 turbines are scheduled to start producing power in 2018, the Ethiopian authorities said earlier this year. Cairo is primarily concerned at the speed at which the dam's reservoir would be filled. The Blue and the White Nile converge in Sudan's capital Khartoum and from there run north through Egypt to the Mediterranean. Simegnew's death is the second of a high-profile company official in recent months. In May, gunmen ambushed and killed Deep Kamra, the country manager for Nigeria's Dangote Cement, alongside two others in the Oromia region outside Addis Ababa.
