Music veteran Yvonne Chaka Chaka has lost many close friends over the last few years but says that as she gets older she doesn't worry too much about death, but about the legacy she will leave behind. The 53-year-old star recently drew applause from fans after appearing on a TV show with Karen Zoid with silver roots. Yvonne told TshisaLIVE that she has decided to embrace growing older, but that doesn't mean she is planning to retire. "I am never going to dye my grey. I love it. It shows that I have lived. I travel around the world and I see children dying at the age of five, so I am grateful for my life lived and I want to use it to help make a difference. I want to reach out and also make a difference through my music. As long as there is something to fight for, I won't retire or shy away." She said that she had lost a lot of close friends over the last few years, including Bra Hugh Masekela, but wouldn't allow the thought of death to distract her from giving back. "I don't worry much about death. When I was younger I was scared and wouldn't even talk about it, now I don't care. Life is for the living. If I was to die today, I would be gone. I don't worry because maybe I'll be in a better place. Here you worry about crime and poverty, but when you are dead, you are dead. There is none of that worry." Ma Yvonne wants to use her experience to help others, leading to Ma Winnie Mandela once asking her to mentorÂ songstress Zahara. "I really love her. When I saw her for the first time, I was blown away and told everyone that this girl was going to go places. I think the important thing is to keep your feet on the ground and know what you want to do, you will always remain a star. I think that and working hard. There is no substitute."
