As two impala locked horns in the Kruger National Park they probably didn't count on a leopard interrupting their skirmish. As the tussle makes its way onto the road, aÂ well-camouflaged leopard leaps out and surprises the two impala which bolt in opposite directions. From the gasps of surprise, it's not clear who was more shocked - the impala, the tourists or the leopard who lost a meal.
