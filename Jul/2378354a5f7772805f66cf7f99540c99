If you're in the habit of packing some sort of powder into your carry-on bag - such as cosmetics, dry shampoo, coffee, baby powder, and protein mixes - take note: as of July 2018, new restrictions apply. Anyone boarding a direct flight to the US from an international airport will face extra scrutiny if they are carrying powders over 340g. The change is partly because of a foiled plot to blow up an Etihad Airways plane flying out of Australia last July. Powders have also long been a concern as a way to smuggle improvised explosives and pepper spray. A statement by American Airlines clarifying the new law says passengers should place powder-like substances over 350ml - about the size of a can of cooldrink - in their checked bags. Otherwise, your powders may require secondary screening, and if they cannot be cleared by security officials, they will be prohibited from the cabin of the aircraft. This policy does not apply to flights departing from the US. Australia will also be enforcing stricter rules as of July. All passengers flying out of Australia on international flights and those on domestic flights departing from international terminals will have their carry-on powders screened. Baby formula, medicine, and cremated human remains are, however, exempt.
