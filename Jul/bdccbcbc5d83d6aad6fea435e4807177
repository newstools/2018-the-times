She posted a brief video on her Insta stories and said "hey, guess what happened." The video gave fans a glimpse of Jo-Ann while she was breastfeeding. Less than 24 hours before the TV personality was giving fans a glimpse of her belly and dancing in front of a mirror. Jo-Ann earlier confirmed baby number three was another princess. "Who run the world? Girls! And in a few weeks time, we'll have two and a strong big brother to help look after his sisters," she wrote. Congrats.
