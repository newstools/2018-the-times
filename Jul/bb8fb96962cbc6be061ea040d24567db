Frozen For You was launched by Karen Short, founder of the By Word of Mouth catering company. It offers a selection of frozen prepared meals that are ordered online and delivered (to certain areas in Gauteng) or collected at the company's store in Dainfern, Johannesburg. The promise is a "frozen fresh" wholesome home-style selection of meals that can simply be heated from frozen in the tray or container. Excellent standby option to have in the freezer. A seasonal menu that offers a selection of dishes. Lots of lovely wintry ideas with chicken, beef, fish, lamb, vegetarian, pasta and soups. And some desserts too. They offer a good mix of family favourites. I ordered a bobotie, fish pie and coq au vin, which was the highlight. It was a generous portion of succulent chicken in a rich wine gravy and I loved the big mushrooms and bacon in the dish. Ordering online is a cinch and efficient. My order arrived the next morning, everything frozen and labelled. Niggle? The bobotie was quite sloppy. Meals range from around R88 for bobotie (640g) and R140 for coq au vin (640g) to R160 for an 800g fish pie. Delivery is R40 extra (in and around Gauteng).
