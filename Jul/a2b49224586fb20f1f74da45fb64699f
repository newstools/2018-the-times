Enhle Mbali's take on the #InMyFeelings challenge is just pure flames. If you've been living under a rock, and have no clue what we're talking about, let us quickly balance you. Ever since Drake released his 25-track album, fans have been going crazy over it and started a dance challenge for his song, In My Feelings. The catchy track seems to be a fan fave and the dance challenge has been blowing up the internet. Enhle Mbali who is one yummy-mommy decided to join in the fun. And, all we have to say is this is an entire mood!
