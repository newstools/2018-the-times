The time has come. From Wednesday August 1, Times Select, South Africa’s first digital daily, will be available to subscribers only — along with a brand-new mobile app. Since our launch in February this year, Times Select’s eclectic mix of stories, analysis and opinion in an easy-to-read format – and free to read until now – has attracted a loyal readership. Now we are taking the next step to ensure we can keep delivering your daily dose of essential journalism. As we’ve promised since the closure of The Times newspaper last year, subscribers to the print edition of the Sunday Times will have free access to Times Select. But we also have a thank-you gift for loyal Times Select readers who are not Sunday Times subscribers: your first month after the launch of the paywall will still be free. Keep an eye on your inbox for an e-mail from us. If you’ve already registered using a different e-mail address, you can register again with your other e-mail address, which will link to your print subscription, or contact us at Tel: 0860 52 52 00 or helpdesk@timeslive.co.za for assistance.
