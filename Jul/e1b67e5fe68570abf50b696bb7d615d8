A mixed bag of wishes – that is what South African economists are offering President Cyril Ramaphosa after his challenge to ministers to come up with a plan to help consumers cope with rising costs. The usual suspects are there: get rid of costly parastatals, rethink land expropriation without compensation. And economist Dawie Roodt even threw in some tough love: “People have to accept the reality that South Africa is getting poorer and start cutting back on their living standards.” But independent economist Ntombana Mbele reckons old-fashioned networking and talking to one another might prove an excellent start. Ministers in the economic cluster were given two weeks to come up with a plan to deal with the ever-rising cost of living for South Africans, particularly the staggering petrol hikes.
