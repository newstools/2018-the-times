The reaction to Masechaba Ndlovu's decision to separate from her husband on Twitter left Bonnie Mbuli shocked, as many people have spurred vile things at her. Bonnie was shocked to see that people had apparently called Masechaba "damaged" and threw even more insults towards her instead of showering her with support. When Bonnie caught a whiff of the slander thrown Masechaba's way, she could not believe it. Bonnie responded to one tweep saying that women should be more supportive of each other. She expressed her sadness at the way women never hesitate to judge each other and implored women to change it. Masechaba revealed on Thursday that she decided to separate from her estranged hubby Vusi, calling it one of the hardest decisions she has ever had to make. Masechaba made the announcement to fans in a social media post late on Wednesday evening. She expressed her reasons in the post. See it below:
