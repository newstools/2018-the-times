Former president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane has been ordered to appear in court on July 12 to face two charges culpable homicide related to a 2014 car accident. Duduzane Zuma’s lawyer Gary Mazaham confirmed that he had received the summons‚ but said he was not in a position to comment on whether Zuma would appear at the Randburg Magistrate's Court. “At this time‚ I have no instructions on that‚” he said‚ “Personally‚ I can see no reason why he should not appear.” Confirmation of the summons issued against Zuma – for culpable homicide and alternatively reckless driving – comes as his family announced late on Sunday that his younger brother Vusi had died after a short illness. It remains unclear whether Zuma‚ who Mazaham confirmed is currently not in the country‚ will attend his younger brother’s funeral. Zuma has been charged over the deaths of two minibus taxi passengers. Phumzile Dube was killed in February 2014 after his Porsche collided with the taxi in which she was travelling. Her fellow passenger Nanki Jeanette Mashaba‚ who was injured in the accident‚ reportedly died in hospital a few weeks after the crash. In August 2015‚ the NPA decided not to prosecute the former president's son‚ despite Magistrate Lalitha Chetty finding‚ during a formal judicial inquest into the death‚ that there was prima facie evidence that Dube's death had been caused by the younger Zuma's negligent actions. But‚ after AfriForum and former prosecutor Gertie Nel announced that they intended to pursue a private prosecution against Zuma‚ the state reconsidered that decision‚ and sought representations from Zuma on why he should not face charges. The National Prosecuting Authority has now confirmed that Zuma has been summonsed to appear in court. Should he fail to do so‚ a warrant of arrest may be issued against him.
