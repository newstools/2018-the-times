Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini is opening up his palaces as tourists attractions, like the Buckingham Palace in London, to raise funds for nine new development projects including a Disney-styled cultural theme park. The monarch announced the investment project at eNyokeni palace where a lavish birthday celebration attended by hundreds of guests, including Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Zweli Mkhize, ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe and mining mogul Patrice Motsepe, was held on Friday. The project is in line with the KwaZulu-Natal governmentâ€™s plan, mooted more than a decade ago, to use the Zulu monarch as a tourist attraction to raise money to maintain his lavish lifestyle. This did not materialise. The idea was to promote Zulu royalty and turn the palaces into a tourist paradise where people could have an audience with the king.
