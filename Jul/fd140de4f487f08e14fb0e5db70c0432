It has emerged that popular Muvhango actor Macdonald Ndou is officially a married man. The fiercely private actor managed to keep the exciting news under the radar up until today when one of his friends shared pictures from the special day. Tshinondiwa Thovhakale decribed the special occasion, which apparently took place two weeks ago as a "Venda love story". She also shared a heartwarming congratulatory message to Macdonald.

I hope this marriage brings with it all your heart has ever desired. May you love her, respect her and treasure her. I’m super proud of you."

Macdonald pulled out all the stops on his special day, wearing a deep purple suit, while his bride looked breathtaking. Here's a glimpse into the special day. (Swipe left neh)
