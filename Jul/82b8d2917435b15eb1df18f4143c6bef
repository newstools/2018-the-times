Congratulations South Africa, you have been gifted two new martyrs. In the past week, there has been an almost biblical transfiguration before our eyes. Tom Moyane and Duduzane Zuma went from being active participants and enablers of state capture to people who have been ill-treated by the establishment and deserve our sympathy. On Monday, Moyane “hosted” a media briefing, ostensibly to present his side of the story on his suspension and the allegations of wilful mismanagement of the South African Revenue Service, some of which were aired at the Nugent commission of inquiry into governance at the tax authority.

According to Mabuza, Moyane is victim of “trial by media”, specifically journalists who have “personal grudges” against him.
