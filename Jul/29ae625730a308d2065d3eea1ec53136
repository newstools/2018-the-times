Former Ecuador president Rafael Correa said Wednesday that an arrest warrant issued by a court in his homeland over a kidnapping was part of a "plot" by the government against him. "There is a whole roadmap, there is a whole plot," Correa said in an interview in Brussels where he is now based, accusing current Ecuadoran president Lenin Moreno saying he "is behind this".
