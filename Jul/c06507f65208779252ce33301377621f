Connie shared a video of little Ronewa attempting to say his prayers. The attempt is filled with giggles and love, with Shona eventually saying "it's time to sleep." The actress simply captioned the image "the joy" with the hashtag love lives here. Check out the cute video for yourself and prepare to let your heart feel warmer.
