The office of French President Emmanuel Macron told AFP on Friday that it has begun dismissal proceedings against a top security aide who violently struck a protester during a demonstration in Paris in May. A video released this week shows Alexandre Benalla manhandling and striking a demonstrator while wearing a police helmet, even though he is not an officer. Paris prosecutors also said Benalla has been detained for questioning in the assault inquiry, where he also faces charges of impersonating a police officer.
