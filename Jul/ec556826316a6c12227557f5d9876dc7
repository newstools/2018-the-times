Why was the luxury car belonging to the eThekwini Municipality speaker parked at an Umlazi garage in the early hours of the morning? What led to a woman being fatally shot by the driver, and who covered it up? These are some of questions before the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) following the shooting of 30-year-old Thandeka Gwala outside a garage in Q-section in the early hours of July 1.

After the shooting Zuma dragged her bleeding body into the car and drove to Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital where he dumped her body.

Municipal officials declined to comment, saying this was a criminal matter, and referred queries to the police. Read the full story on Times Select.
