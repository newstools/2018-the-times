Peter Dutton, the Australian minister who wants to fast-track the relocation of white South African farmers to his country, says that his critics are dead to him. This is, of course, a lie. Dutton’s critics are political gold to him. After all, if you’ve decided to exploit South Africa’s explosive land issue to score points with your cracker constituency in Queensland, what’s the only priceless gift no amount of money or publicity can buy?
