Taste is a subjective thing, but when you gather a group of experts and ask them to blind-taste hot cross buns from four major supermarkets, you have a fair way of assessing quality. For this taste test, the judges were Professor Gerrie du Rand of the Department of Consumer and Food Sciences at the University of Pretoria and 30 of her final-year students. Using the facilities at the department, the products were unwrapped, numbered and where required prepared exactly to package instructions. The students were asked to judge each product according to appearance, aroma, taste and texture, as well as to say whether they would consider buying it. What is interesting is that there is always a clear winner in each category and the comments reflect similar sentiments.
