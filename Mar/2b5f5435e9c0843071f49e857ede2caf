A new book claims that Atul Gupta declared that “ugly old bitches” would not be hired to work for ANN7. Instead – after a number of experienced broadcasters would not join the channel because of possible damage to their reputation given the Gupta family’s links to The New Age newspaper – he decided to hire models. This is according to Rajesh Sundarum‚ who has penned a book about having to help launch the channel in 2013.
