More than seven hours after the Nelson Mandela Bay council convened this morning‚ not a single agenda item has been concluded. According to HeraldLIVE‚ both the special council sitting scheduled for 8am on Thursday morning and the ordinary council meeting which was scheduled to start at 10am were disrupted by spurious points of order‚ screaming matches between political parties and at least three adjournments. After council speaker Jonathan Lawack‚ whose head is also on the chopping block‚ announced that discussions regarding the special sitting were suspended‚ the council broke into chaos. DA councillor Sandile Rhwexwana nearly came to blows with the ANC’s Mvuzo Mbelekane. Meanwhile‚ EFF councillor Zilindile Vena confronted PA councillor and new ruling coalition partner Marlon Daniels regarding their midnight meeting this week following news that the PA would be voting with the DA. Fellow caucus member UF councillor Mkhuseli Mtsila said that‚ while at Daniels’ home‚ the PA councillor had said he would “kill the DA from the inside” and that he wanted to “beat up Athol Trollip”. Soon after‚ an argument broke out between a couple of DA and ANC councillors. Lawack then adjourned the meeting for 30 minutes. The meeting scheduled to debate an EFF motion of no confidence in DA mayor Athol Trollip. Here are some of the interesting moments from inside and outside chambers:
