A Sierra Leone court upheld a request by a member of the ruling party for an injunction on Saturday to delay a presidential election run-off that was meant to happen next Tuesday. The member, Ibrahim Sorie Koroma, filed for the injunction on Thursday, saying there was evidence of electoral fraud that needed to be investigated before the poll could go ahead.
