Properties belonging to the Gupta family have reportedly been raided in India. Journalist Neha Poonia‚ who has covered the Gupta family’s movements in India recently for the SABC‚ tweeted on Tuesday that the properties had been searched by income tax officials. “Income Tax officials in India are also making enquiries about their company Sahara. Properties of #Gupta family friend - Amar Gupta also raided. I'm being told that the family's properties in other parts of the country are also being raided simultaneously‚” she tweeted. A source close to the investigation in India confirmed to TimesLIVE that raids had been carried out at various Gupta-owned properties by income tax officials‚ but could not provide further details. The Ministry of External Affairs was not immediately available to comment. TimesLIVE reported in February that fugitive from justice Ajay Gupta had attended a wedding and then retired to a palatial property in northern India as former president Jacob Zuma resigned from office. The Times of India reported that Gupta – who is being sought by the Hawks – had arrived in Dehradun on February 13 after attending a wedding. “The Guptas have a palatial bungalow in Curzon Road in the city‚ where Ajay is believed to have stayed till February 16‚ a day after the news of Zuma’s resignation broke out. During his stay in Dehradun‚ the businessman did not leave the bungalow and remained inside‚” reported The Times of India. This is a developing story.
