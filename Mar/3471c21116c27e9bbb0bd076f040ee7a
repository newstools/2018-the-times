Suspended SA Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane racked up a dubious list of “achievements” as head of the nation's tax collection authority‚ says investigative journalist Jacques Pauw. At the top of that list‚ were his efforts to halt an investigation into the tax affairs of former president Jacob Zuma. Moyane was suspended with immediate effect on Monday after refusing to step down when asked to by President Cyril Ramaphosa. Pauw‚ who revealed sensational allegations about Zuma’s tax affairs in his book The President’s Keepers‚ compiled a list of Moyane’s “achievements” while in office. Moyane had‚ he alleged in a post on Facebook: Pauw alleged that Moyane was corrupt‚ had no tax knowledge and was “arguably Zuma’s worst appointment ever”. The presidency‚ in reaction to claims in the book about Zuma having failed to submit tax returns for his first four years in office‚ said he was tax compliant. “The tax matters of the president are in order‚" said the presidency. Ramaphosa said in a sharply worded letter‚ informing Moyane about his suspension on Monday: “You have… failed in your role as an accounting officer for SARS. As a result‚ the SARS has been fundamentally jeopardised and has lost the confidence of taxpayers.” Moyane said in a letter to Ramaphosa that he would challenge his removal in court‚ adding: "It was glaring that you have already made a decision to dismiss me.”
