A couple of gun-wielding criminals were caught on a CCTV camera trying to either rob the occupants of a silver Ford Fiesta, or hijack the car in Robertsham in Johannesburg. The Fiesta drives up a driveway and is blocked in by another vehicle outside of the gate and two men holding guns get out of the car. But a passing car disturbs the criminals, who then get back into their car and speed off.
