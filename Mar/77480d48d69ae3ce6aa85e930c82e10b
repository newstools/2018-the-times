A burglar rifling through a house got an unexpected birthday gift – his own pair of handcuffs. Cape Town metro police officers on patrol in Rondebosch East were alerted to a burglary in progress just after noon on Friday. Metro police spokesperson Sergeant Ruth Solomons said a resident told officers that the thief was still inside his home. “Officers followed up and did a sweep of the premises‚” said Solomons. The burglar was caught red-handed. “They found the suspect in one of the rooms‚ still busy collecting his bounty‚” she said. But‚ there was a twist in the tale. “The 30-year-old suspect was arrested and detained at Athlone SAPS. Officers discovered that it is his birthday while registering the case docket.”
