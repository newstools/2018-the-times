Through it‚ I am now doing a learnership programme at Sasol." Joseph Mahlangu‚ 26‚ is also‚ through the YES initiative working as a recruiter for Lulaway recruitment agency. "I am so grateful for this opportunity because I also get to motivate young people to not give up. "I was out of a job for a year after graduating in industrial psychology at the University of the Free State." The YES initiative aims to see more than one million young people being offered paid work experience over the next three years‚ as part of placing the needs of and opportunities for young people at the centre of inclusive economic growth.
