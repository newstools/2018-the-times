To be honest, there is really no guessing whatÂ  provokes Emtee on Twitter these days. Twitter was too stunned to understand what was happening on Wednesday night when the rapper started asking people to come and be face-to-face. History has taught us that the rapper will come for tweeps and has spicy clapback for days, but it used to be kinda alright because he would be hitting back at hate or his previous Ambitiouz squad. On Wednesday night he announced that he had never actually had anyone confront him with beef personally, be it in music or physically. He also tweeted that he's ready to part with a cool R10k for a person brave enough. Of course tweeps called his bluff. Twitter doesn't think Emtee can actually take on anybody in a physical fight. However, they are willing to consider that he may be a worthy opponent in the rap department. While his initial threats were a bit more general, Emtee proceeded to go for the person Twitter believes was the intended recipient all along. Cc: Mufasa. He went in with the shade throwing: Obvs the Tsibipians made the head Tsibip aware. Cassper replied. All we gonna do is quote the great K.O in Run Jozi and say: "Next thing you know your career is over." Mfana, over some characters?
