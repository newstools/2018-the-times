Mi Casa's J'Something and Mo T have teamed up with some friends to launch a series of gospel nights, but don't worry, it doesn't spell the end of Mi Casa as we know it. J started the initiative, called Spirit Being several months ago and there has already been two nights filled with praise and worship to the sounds of J's guitar and Mo T's trumpet. They plan to hold another event next month. J' told TshisaLIVE that the idea for the event came after he started having his friends over to chat and catch up, and as their meetings grew bigger and bigger, they decided to have a praise and workshop service at their church. "It has grown into this thing where hundreds of people come and worship God. I just lead it from a music point and we just have fun. It is church, but there's not preaching. It doesn't matter what you believe in, it's just an evening to worship together and encourage each other. It is such an important part of my life because it is good for me." Mo said the events would not pull the guys away from Mi Casa and there are no plans to release a gospel album in the future. "It's not even a full on Mi Casa thing. It is something J started and it is his baby. I am supporting him as a friend and I am also part of it. We just got together as friends and we enjoy spending time together doing something as great as this."
