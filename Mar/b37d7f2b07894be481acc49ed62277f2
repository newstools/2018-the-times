Q. What actually happens during an appointment with a sex therapist? A. Sex therapy is usually provided by psychologists, physicians or licensed therapists who have special training in issues related to sex and relationships. Sex therapy can help you resolve various sexual issues, from concerns about sexual function or feelings to the way you relate to your partner. Such as concerns about sexual desire or arousal, orgasm, sexual interests or sexual orientation. Erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, painful intercourse, intimacy issues related to a disability or chronic condition. Some concerns may be linked to issues such as stress, anxiety or depression, chronic illness, medication side-effects, surgery or ageing. Talking about sex and intimacy may feel awkward but certified health professionals who are sex therapists are trained at putting you at ease, skilled at identifying and making recommendations. You should ask what the sex therapist's educational and training background and if they have experience with your specific type of sexual issue. Just remember: sexual coaching that involves physical contact is not part of mainstream sex therapy and is against the ethics of licensed health providers. A complete medical evaluation can help determine the nature of your problem and the treatment options that may be appropriate. Sex therapy is usually short term. Some concerns can be addressed quickly, in just a few visits. Typically, several counselling sessions are needed. Trust and good communication with your therapist is important... If you don't have a good rapport with your therapist to lead to effective resolution of your concerns, consider finding another therapist. • Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng (MBChB), sexual and reproductive health practice, DISA Clinic, 011-886-2286, visit safersex.co.za Do you have a question about sex?
