Former Miss SA Ntando Mthethwa couldn't be a happier bride and said it is a blessing to be a Mrs. She and musician Khaya Mthethwa got married last year after dating for three months. She told Isolezwe a lot has changed since she got hitched but she is grateful. "Everything happened quickly and we made a decision to get married. I'm a pastor's wife now and the congregations welcomed me with open arms." Ntando told the paper she is from a religious household and being married to a pastor has only enriched her life. "Khaya is a good a man and I have learnt a lot from him, especially since we started living together. Even though he is away a lot for work, he is a loving and caring husband."
