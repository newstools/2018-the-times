Skolopad has asked her followers to plead with Lerato Kganyago to unblock her after what she thought was a joke landed her on Lerato blocked list. It comes after Twitter is sure that Lerato and Cassper are an item and have even used their Photoshop skills on snaps of the pair. Lerato has denied it, several times, but that didn't stop Skolopad from giving her two cents. And then Lerato took her out the game. Even though it looked like most of Skolopad's Twitter buddies were also blocked by Lerato, the few that are not blocked attempted to plead Skolopad's case. Despite the apologies on behalf of Skolopad from her fans, Lerato wasn't swayed. The radio DJ even went on to say that when people threaten her sanity and then ask why she blocks them were "bordering psychotic". After hearing about Lerato's comments, Skolopad read between the lines and took it to heart.
