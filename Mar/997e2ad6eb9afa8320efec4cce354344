They should also be strong and have a good temperament‚” Sewpersad added. If you have a dog to donate‚ Metro police officers will make an appointment to assess the animal. “Dogs are donated unconditionally to the DMPS [Durban Metro Police Service]. Suitable dogs will be examined by the DMPS veterinary services‚ inoculated and tagged with a microchip. They will then be socialised and assessed to determine their suitability for K9 training. Trained dogs will be deployed operationally as a patrol dog.” He said the generosity of the public would contribute to ensuring the safety and security of South Africans.
