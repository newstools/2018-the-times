Walter Sisulu University (WSU) shut three of its four campuses on Thursday amid fears for people’s safety. “We have closed campus. It is not safe for staff and students because we cannot guarantee their safety‚ therefore they must leave‚” university spokeswoman Yonela Tukwayo said. Violence spilt onto the N2 outside Butterworth when hundreds of WSU Ibika students set up a blockade and police opened fire with rubber bullets‚ while students threw rocks at the police before scattering. The university has been thrust into chaos and violence this week‚ starting with a shootout and infighting among security guards in which a student and three guards were injured‚ the torching and damaging of vehicles‚ as well as street blockades in East London on Wednesday night. The burning issue for students is a shortage of decent accommodation‚ which has led to overcrowded student rooms. Tukwayo said WSU did not have the money to repair residences. - Daily Dispatch
